0:17
little motivation I watched the garyvee

Shervin's Early Days
0:59
before you became a YouTuber you were a
1:01
software engineer and you had like a
1:03
pretty big six figure job but you left
1:05
it all so yeah tell me tell me why you
1:06
did that you know I did everything my
1:08
parents had told me to do which was you
1:10
know study hard go to college get a good
1:12
job and then I came to the realization
1:15
that like all right now I have 50 years
1:17
of my life left is this what I really
1:19
want to be doing but it was just the
1:21
desire to chase something that kind of
1:24
like internally this internal voice is
1:25
telling me hey you got to go chase after
1:27
something that just doesn't make logical
1:28
sense right now did anyone help you or
How he made the decision to quit
1:30
how did you come to the decision to
1:32
finally quit how did that look so funny
1:34
stories I quit my job twice technically
1:36
once was the software engineering job
1:38
and then I kind of like did YouTube and
1:40
kind of explored and I became a product
1:41
manager and then I quit that job too
1:43
there was no one else like I think all
1:44
my friends were working regular jobs
1:46
they're enjoying it they're doing well
1:47
financially and I watched the garyvee
1:50
video and he's like if you just
1:52
graduated college like you need to chase
1:54
your dreams this is dreams we're talking
1:56
about
1:57
we're talking about dreams hey this is
1:59
the time to be high risk and I was like
2:01
he's so right like in five years if I'm
2:03
married and have kids
2:05
[Laughter]
2:08
because like in five years if I'm
2:09
married and have kids I won't be able to
2:11
take a massive risk like you can't just
2:13
quit your job because you have to pay
2:14
for your mortgage or whatever else like
2:16
you're supporting other people
2:18
so I was like Now's the Time just take
2:20
the risk what's the worst thing that can
2:21
happen I can always go back into a
2:23
software engineering job and that's when
2:25
I kind of like decided and then I just
2:27
became like okay how do we go about it
2:29
and journaling journaling journaling
2:31
journaling and then finally one day I
2:33
was just like this is the end quitting
When is the right time to quit?
2:34
your job for YouTube is a crazy move how
2:36
much you have saved up do you have a
2:37
backup plan at the time so I had a lot
2:39
of Investments
2:41
um from software engineering luckily
2:43
that I had put like in retirement
2:44
account and then like other assets and I
2:47
was fortunate enough that those assets
2:49
had grown immensely so I had kind of
2:51
like a asset I could pull from if I
2:54
really needed an emergency but in my
2:56
bank account I think I had like five or
2:58
ten thousand dollars but I felt
3:00
comfortable because I had like those
3:01
assets backing me and I was like if I
3:02
really need more money I'll sell stuff
3:04
and I'll use that money but I didn't
3:06
really want to sell anything at the time
3:07
but you're able to make it off of five
3:10
ten thousand at least in the beginning
3:11
yes uh so luckily YouTube was already
3:14
making some money I was making I think
3:16
two to three thousand a month and I was
3:18
like as long as I can increase that
3:20
Revenue by focusing more on that then I
3:22
should be fine so I really just focused
3:24
on increasing that revenue and I cut my
3:26
personal costs as low as possible
3:28
and that's kind of how I lived and for
3:30
the most part that was helping me and I
3:32
recently just started paying myself
Cutting down personal expenses
3:33
through the business you said that you
3:35
brought your personal expenses down to
3:37
basically nothing what did that look
3:38
like uh that was kind of like moving
3:40
back into my parents so no rents they
3:42
paid for food
3:44
um I didn't have to pay for a car
3:46
so I had the lucky opportunity that I
3:50
could lean on them so that was kind of
3:51
the big thing I was like all right how
3:53
can I go about using this as as a as a
3:56
way to kind of not have to spend too
3:58
much money being a YouTuber for anyone
How much is costs to do YouTube
4:00
else who wants to do YouTube full-time
4:02
how much you used to have to spend as a
4:03
YouTuber you don't have to spend any
4:05
money and you have to spend all the
4:06
money I think it's all hard work and
4:08
dedication like one thing I've really
4:09
prided myself is trying to meet as many
4:11
other creators as possible and the big
4:14
thing you learn from that is a lot of
4:15
people don't want it they say they want
4:17
it they're like yeah I want to do this I
4:18
want to do that or I have this dream but
4:20
no one wants it if you're hungry enough
4:22
you could do it that's that's the part
4:24
that I've realized like so many people
4:25
just say things but they don't actually
4:27
put in the work if you put in the work
4:28
day in day out there's nothing stopping
What is takes to be a YouTuber
4:31
you how can you tell if someone really
4:32
wants it it's not about how they talk
4:34
it's about what they publish like are
4:36
they publishing consistently are they
4:38
adapting and learning and growing and
4:40
are they asking questions like one thing
4:42
I struggle with is asking for help but
4:44
I've realized that even people who like
4:46
I'm not a big Creator but people who
4:48
might be like one step behind me if they
4:49
ask me for feedback like okay that
4:51
person is hungry and then I'm like okay
4:53
maybe I should be asking other people
4:54
for feedback too so that like shows that
4:57
you want to learn and you want to get
4:59
better when you first got started how
First starting on YouTube
5:01
much time were you spending creating
5:03
videos and like how many subscribers did
5:05
you have in the early days I was doing
5:07
like I think daily Vlogs were were the
5:09
thing back then so I was like oh I need
5:11
to publish every single day so I would
5:13
record during the day edit at night and
5:15
then publish the next morning and I did
5:16
a couple like 30 day 90 day challenges
5:19
um and I think I had like 100 maybe 200
Best YouTube upload schedule
5:22
subscribers at the time how many videos
5:23
were you putting out what was your what
5:25
was your output look uh I think it was
5:26
once a week twice a week I still switch
5:29
between that I'm trying to do like I did
5:31
three months where I was like we're
5:32
doing twice a week and then I scaled it
5:34
back to once a week but for the most
5:36
part I think twice a week once a week or
5:38
twice a month are probably like the
5:40
three best cadences for YouTube is what
5:43
I've learned and noticed from most
How long did it take to get 1K subscribers?
5:44
people so how long did it take you to
5:46
get to a thousand subscribers was that a
5:48
big Mark for you
5:50
I've heard this great quote 100
5:52
subscribers is the hardest a thousand is
5:54
the next hardest ten thousand is a
5:55
little bit harder 100 000 is a little
5:57
easier and then a million is even easier
6:00
and I think it's because the Snowball
6:01
Effect right I I don't remember how long
6:04
it took me to get to like a thousand but
6:05
I remember it was like years like two
6:08
years maybe uh just posting content and
6:11
I wasn't really analyzing what was
6:13
bringing in subscribers I was just
6:14
posting out of like oh this is fun I
6:17
like this let's just keep doing it
6:19
um but it took like two maybe three
How long until you made $$$ from YouTube?
6:20
years and how long did it take to make
6:22
your first dollar through your videos so
6:25
before the one thousand four thousand
6:27
hours limit that YouTube had I was
6:30
monetized and I was making like ten
6:33
dollars a month within the first year
6:35
that I started YouTube and then they
6:36
created that cap and I was under the
6:38
1000 subscribers so they cut off my
6:41
money and I think I made like 300 over a
6:43
year but that was the first like couple
6:45
dollars that came in and you couldn't
6:46
get the money until you hit 100
6:48
threshold so I was like I would see it
6:49
right
6:51
we need 20 more to get the cash and how
Different ways to make money on YouTube
6:54
did you make that money was it just
6:55
through YouTube AdSense that first it
6:57
was all YouTube AdSense I know you make
7:00
money through lots of different ways now
7:01
uh how did you find those and what does
7:03
that look like for you I started to make
7:05
videos that were kind of search based
7:07
um and like we were product reviews like
7:09
one of them was like a fitness tracker
7:11
band and I was like oh they gave me like
7:14
a referral link you know sometimes they
7:15
say oh put your link in the app like oh
7:17
you get one month three if you refer
7:19
someone so it's like all right let's do
7:20
it so I put that link in there and the
7:23
video got some views and then all of a
7:25
sudden I had three years of membership
7:28
and I was like what do I do with this
7:30
and then I became 10 years of membership
7:32
and I was like what do I do with this so
7:34
then the company reached out to me and
7:35
they're like hey we have an affiliate
7:36
program
7:38
um it's invite only do you want to be in
7:39
it and I think of course like what am I
7:41
going to do with 10 years of membership
7:42
so that was the first time they're like
7:44
okay here's your link instead of getting
7:46
a free month which was like I don't know
7:48
30 bucks or something we'll give you 50
7:49
dollars and I was like all right that
7:53
sounds better like a cash over like this
7:55
thing that is not really like attainable
7:57
and that was the first time that I
7:59
started to get like some amount of cash
8:01
and I was like all right let's replace
8:02
that link and then I was like okay so it
8:04
looks like if I make a product review
8:06
and people are searching the review and
8:08
I provide value
8:10
um and some people will decide not to
8:13
buy it because of my video and some
8:14
people will and if I tell them to use my
8:15
link then I can make some money so that
8:17
helps support making more videos could
His income streams
8:19
you break down all the different ways
8:21
that you make that you make money as
8:22
YouTuber I know affiliate marketing
8:24
YouTube AdSense maybe do you have any
8:26
brand deals could you break it all down
8:27
for us yeah
8:28
um right now it's just affiliate
8:30
marketing and YouTube AdSense I'm
8:32
starting to get into sponsorships but I
8:34
don't really want to yet because I want
8:35
to like optimize for watch time and I
8:38
don't know it's like a fear that maybe
8:39
if I put a sponsorship in like views are
8:41
gonna drop I think it's probably like 80
8:43
20 20 is YouTube AdSense 80 is uh
8:46
affiliate marketing
8:48
and then Within like there's two major
8:51
companies that cover most of the AdSense
8:53
probably around 50 of that and then the
8:56
rest is like a whole bunch of other
8:57
small
8:58
um companies this is my bedroom very
Living in NYC as a creator
9:01
tiny
9:04
New York City boy yeah
9:07
so living in New York City is obviously
9:09
really expensive how are you able to
9:11
live in New York as a Creator
9:13
um you just have to give out an arm and
9:14
a leg I think part of it I was lucky and
9:17
fortunate enough to meet two other
9:18
creators who were also chasing the same
9:20
thing and we're like
9:21
we figured out what we wanted to
9:23
prioritize and for me it was like
9:25
location I want to be surrounded by
9:26
other creators and we know a lot of
9:28
other creators who kind of live near
9:29
this area and then the second aspect was
9:31
save as much plenty as possible so we
9:33
try to find the cheapest place where all
9:35
three of us could live in and this was
9:37
it like it provided bedrooms for all of
9:40
us it has a nice big living room so that
9:42
way we can like have our desks and
9:43
create content it kind of got our basic
9:46
needs met so it's just cut costs as low
9:48
as possible and get like your high
9:50
priority items yeah and that's it and
Cost of living in NYC
9:52
how much does this place cost for rent
9:54
in the whole place and in this room we
9:55
pay 4 500 for three of us so me and my
9:59
roommate changes we pay 1600 and then uh
10:02
Colt our third roommate pays the rest
10:03
and do you eat out a lot or what how do
10:06
you saving money
10:07
I'm trying to cut that down so actually
10:10
one video I'm working on is how to make
10:11
homemade meals in less than two minutes
10:13
and save money that way as well as like
10:16
optimize time so I have like a little
10:18
Smart Oven thing that I use and that
10:20
helps me like cook most of my meals nice
10:22
and what are the other big expenses as a
10:25
new NYC Creator what is it other than
10:27
rent and food what do you spending
10:29
coffee
10:30
this place is so small like it's nice to
10:32
just change your environment and go
10:33
outside somewhere so I like to go work
10:35
at a coffee shop or meet people at a
10:37
coffee shop that's probably my biggest
10:39
expense and then gym I love working out
10:41
so there was a time where I had two gym
10:43
memberships but now I don't
10:45
um but like going to the gym or a sauna
10:48
and and cold plunge Studio like that's
10:50
another cost so I would say health and
10:53
wellness costs are pretty high anything
10:56
you really want to do in New York City
10:57
it's like almost double the price
10:59
sometimes yeah I think that's a good
Coffee vibes
11:00
segue to go check out a coffee shop and
11:03
right say coffee coffee shop cut the
11:05
coffee shop
11:07
[Music]
Most viral video
11:11
all right so what's been your most like
11:14
successful or viral video
11:16
on YouTube it was definitely the I
11:18
replaced my iPhone with an Apple Watch
11:19
Ultra I think it's around 1.56 million
11:22
views right now and what's the story
11:24
behind it so that's like been a video
11:26
I've done a couple times before and the
11:29
intention behind it was like can I
11:30
survive with just my Apple watch like
11:32
I'm always consuming social media on my
11:34
phone and I want to just like get rid of
11:36
my phone so I was like can I do 24 hours
11:38
just Apple watch and I've done it before
11:41
and it did pretty well I was like all
11:42
right the new Apple watch is coming out
11:44
let's launch this video at the same time
11:46
that all the Apple watch Ultra hype is
11:49
happening so as soon as I got the watch
11:51
I did the video literally the next day
11:52
and I tried to release it as fast as I
11:55
could like I I don't think the editing
11:57
was great it was just like get it out
Viral formula
11:58
now why do you think it went viral
11:59
timing uh topic uh and just having
12:03
previous data that like this style could
12:06
potentially work so I think there's a
12:08
factor of those three things like I know
12:09
this video has worked for me in the past
12:10
timing of Apple watch Ultra and then the
12:13
topic people love Apple watches yeah
12:15
yeah and how did it feel like you're
12:16
getting like all this views Was it crazy
12:20
I think I was like oh I really don't
12:22
care I was like it's not about the views
12:24
like yeah having one viral video is is
12:27
cool I guess but like I want to have an
12:29
Engaged audience and engaged community
12:32
and all those 1.5 million people watch
12:35
the video and never come back like
12:36
what's the point I want people to come
12:38
back I gotta I'd rather have
12:39
consistently a hundred thousand views
12:43
than one video that gets like 10 million
12:45
views so that's kind of my goal
Finding talent + hiring
12:47
[Music]
12:51
you got a team working with you now how
12:53
do you find good editors and good
12:55
filmers and good people to work with
12:57
um I think it's Network either through
12:59
other Creator friends to ask them hey do
13:00
you know anyone who has is available for
13:02
work uh going to different events and
13:04
meeting people and then asking them
13:06
that's probably the biggest one and and
13:08
then online like upwork is a good spot
13:10
it's hard to find good people you really
13:11
have to like go through like hundreds of
13:13
people to finally find a good editor
13:14
that's kind of how I found my first one
13:16
it was cheap I think they were like
13:18
seven to ten dollars an hour yeah and if
13:21
you Outsource it to other countries then
13:22
you can save a ton of money that way
Advice for new creators
13:24
yeah all right so sure what would be
13:26
your advice for anyone that maybe is in
13:28
a full-time job right now and wants to
13:29
create content for a living or be a
13:32
Creator or just to get start creating
13:34
start creating I think uh take a day one
13:37
day a week like your Sundays and
13:39
dedicate that day to creating content
13:41
and just start building momentum because
13:43
that's the most important thing if
13:44
you're not consistently creating then
13:46
it's not worth quitting your job you
13:47
have to first build the momentum build
13:49
the habits of actually doing it and you
13:52
have to sacrifice like some of your
13:53
social life you have to sacrifice other
13:55
things in your life but I think it's
13:56
important to just
13:57
get the ball rolling
How to find video ideas
14:03
you're doing videos on Tech and gadgets
14:06
and fitness how do you find ideas for
14:08
videos yeah it's just a lot of searching
14:10
on YouTube like
14:11
I'll search the topic like right now I'm
14:13
doing a testosterone supplements video
14:16
um and one thing is like I can search
14:18
like the supplements called Tomcat alley
14:20
so it's like I could search that it's
14:21
like okay these videos aren't doing that
14:22
well but if I do testosterone
14:24
supplements maybe that is doing well but
14:26
if I do a video about gaining muscle
14:27
like oh that's going to do extremely
14:29
well so yeah the video might be about
14:31
the same thing but it's like how do I
14:33
frame it and it's about researching and
14:35
then all right what's kind of related to
14:37
this and then looking at other videos
14:38
kind of related to that and then just
14:39
kind of going down a rabbit hole of a
14:41
whole bunch of YouTube videos
14:43
to finally figure out what's the best
14:44
way to kind of frame this video uh and
14:47
then just chasing my Curiosities like
14:48
I'm a very curious person I like to
14:50
think
14:51
so if I'm like I want to learn about
14:53
this I must know like what happens if
14:54
you do this then that kind of becomes an
14:56
idea and then it becomes how do I
14:57
package that idea yeah do you believe
How to meet other creators
14:59
it's important to
15:00
to surround yourself with creators I
15:03
think anything you're trying to achieve
15:04
you must surround yourself with people
15:06
who are also doing the same thing you
15:07
know the five chimps Theory you become
15:09
like the people you're surrounded by
15:12
um so I'm a big believer in that and
15:13
that's why I destroyed myself with other
15:15
creators and then how did I go about
15:16
finding them it was just I went to
15:18
Creator events so like I think I looked
15:21
on Meetup or random things like that
15:22
once you move to a new city it's just
15:24
like you're just searching online to
15:25
find whatever you can and then as soon
15:27
as you meet one then they start to
15:29
invite you to other events and it
15:30
becomes like The Snowball Effect where
15:32
once you have at least like five Creator
15:34
friends like they know about other
15:35
events and it becomes this kind of word
15:36
of mouth thing
15:38
um and it's just like going to these
15:40
dinners going to any kind of event
15:42
that's based around creating content you
15:44
get to meet other people who are also
15:45
doing the same thing and it's kind of
15:48
lonely I would say a lot of creators
15:49
like it's there's not that many creators
15:51
in the world right people who are
15:52
actually serious about it so when you do
15:54
meet other people who are also in the
15:56
space like it's just like an instant
15:57
bond because you know the challenges
15:59
that they've been through
16:01
um and you know like this person is also
16:03
hungry like they're not just like here
16:04
to like lollygag I heard that you're
Running a 5 minute mile
16:06
trying to run a five minute mile how's
16:08
that going
16:09
I got injured but I'm gonna do it
16:13
um I am I want to do it uh if you know a
16:15
guy named Dr Andrew huberman I recently
16:18
learned that he his fastest time is a
16:19
457 so that's my new goal is I want to
16:22
beat his time in the mile
16:24
um
16:25
I think it's like one thing as I'm
16:26
getting older is like my body is I've
16:29
hit the age room my body's deteriorating
16:31
every year so I just want to see like
16:33
what am I physically capable of doing
16:35
and I also want to use that as a goal to
16:38
build these long-term habits for
16:39
longevity of just staying healthy with
16:42
my cardiovascular system but I did get
16:44
injured but I'm slowly getting back into
16:45
running and I'm like I need to take a
16:47
safe approach I'm not a 21 year old
16:49
Invincible man uh just about you know
16:52
maybe this is not going to take longer
16:54
than two months like it's gonna take a
16:55
year two years but chase after that goal
16:58
yeah and how close did you get uh 526 is
17:01
my fastest time so far it's pretty good
17:02
yeah pretty good almost there almost
17:04
there okay

Transcript:
Intro
0:00
this is Danny Miranda the man who went
0:02
from his parents basement to sitting
0:04
down face to face with the most
0:05
influential people in the world how did
0:07
he do it with this laptop in this
0:09
microphone he started a podcast but
0:12
before I tell you about Danny I have to
0:13
remind you about this incredible Joe
0:15
Rogan Joe Rogan you would have heard of
0:18
this guy he's got the most listened to
0:19
podcast in the world Spotify bought the
0:23
Joe Rogan podcast Joe Rogan just got a
0:25
100 million dollar deal from Spotify how
0:28
in the world is a podcast worth 100
0:30
million dollars to find out I flew out
0:32
to Austin Texas to sit down with Danny
0:34
who might just be the next Joe Rogan he
0:36
broke down exactly how he started a
0:38
podcast with zero dollars how it makes
0:40
money and how he's landed some of the
0:42
biggest guests on the internet that's
0:44
how I got Gary vaynerchuk for episode 39
0:46
of the podcast he also shared with me
0:48
the reason why everyone should start a
0:50
podcast and how the business of
0:52
podcasting is a lot bigger than you
0:53
think Danny is proof that anyone with a
0:56
laptop and an internet connection can
0:57
start a podcast that changes their life
0:59
I'm Pat walls and this is starter story
Why podcasting?
1:04
Danny you went from hanging out in your
1:06
parents basement to starting one of the
1:08
most influential podcasts in the world
1:10
you've had guests like Gary vaynerchuk
1:12
and Andy frisella tell me about what
1:14
you're doing and why you're doing it I
1:15
created the Danny Miranda podcast in
1:18
September of 2020 because I enjoyed
1:21
talking to people on the phone and I
1:23
would have such great phone
1:24
conversations that I said I want to
1:26
record this why don't I share this
1:28
information even if no one listens and
1:30
so I started this podcast by putting out
1:32
three episodes a week in September 2020
1:34
and I grew it to the point where 30 to
1:37
50 000 downloads a month and I've talked
1:40
to some of the most interesting people
1:41
in the world who were my heroes and who
1:43
still are and it's been an incredible
1:45
journey tell me a little bit more about
The early days
1:47
that journey I started by thinking about
1:49
who were the people that were
1:50
fascinating me who are the people that I
1:52
I was inspired by that I was curious
1:54
with and how could I talk to them for an
1:57
hour that was Kamal ravacott that was
1:59
gay Hendrix and these books were so
2:02
influential on how I thought that I
2:05
wanted to talk to them I wanted to learn
2:06
more about them their story and connect
2:08
with them and so I didn't really have
2:10
any reason to do that but once I had a
2:12
podcast I suddenly could and that was a
2:15
game changer for me that I had an excuse
2:17
to talk to any person I wanted to for an
2:19
hour or more I know podcasting may seem
The opportunity of podcasting
2:22
like something people just do for fun or
2:24
as a hobby but actually it might be one
2:26
of the biggest opportunities of Our
2:28
Generation tell me more about that
2:29
podcasting as a medium is so new it's
2:32
only been around for 20 years and that
2:35
might sound like a long time but if you
2:36
think about the radio the radio was
2:38
invented in 1895 and so if you think
2:42
about the radio being involved in the
2:44
world in 1915 compared to where it was
2:46
at its peak if you think about
2:48
podcasting compared to that trajectory
2:49
we're in the early days even though it
2:51
seems like everyone and their mom has a
2:53
podcast the truth is that it's just
2:55
getting started and the truth is that
2:57
listenership increases year over year
2:59
the ways of listening increase year over
3:01
year and the desire and hunger for
3:04
conversation has never been higher and
Podcasting business models
3:06
tell me a little bit more about the
3:07
business opportunity of podcasting I
3:09
know that there are businesses behind it
3:11
that are built what have you seen yeah
3:13
so advertising is the most common model
3:15
for the biggest podcast in the world but
3:17
there are other models that I think are
3:19
worth exploring and are interesting one
3:21
is courses or subscriptions to
3:23
newsletters so you funnel people from a
3:26
podcast to a newsletter or to a a course
3:29
another potential Avenue is Consulting
3:32
of some sort so for me I help people and
3:36
connect people to some of my guests they
3:38
help me with money and I help them build
3:41
their podcast up from the ground up so
3:43
on day one of their show they're getting
3:45
phenomenal guests another one that's
3:46
potentially interesting is creating some
3:48
sort of conference or Summit bringing
3:50
the people together that you've had us
3:52
guests and maybe become friends and have
3:54
them as speakers and maybe they'll do it
3:56
at a lesser cost or for free because
3:58
they're your friends then so I think
3:59
there are many different Avenues to
4:01
explore when you're connected to amazing
The biggest podcast businesses
4:02
people what are some of the biggest
4:03
businesses you've seen podcasters build
4:05
and what does that look like so Joe
4:07
Rogan I believe had a 50 stake in on it
4:10
and they sold that company for 300
4:13
million dollars but I think that it's
4:15
the early days I think this is like
4:16
looking at like NBA players in 1970 or
4:20
1980. podcasters are going to have a
4:23
deep connection with people for a long
4:25
amount of time p people who have deep
4:27
connections to a lot of people can build
4:30
amazing huge businesses on top of that
4:32
and so Joe Rogan's Spotify deal of 100
4:34
million or Alex Cooper getting paid 20
4:37
million dollars a year from Spotify as
4:38
well those are the early signs of what's
4:40
to come let's talk about how to get
How to start a podcast
4:42
started with a podcast what is the most
4:43
basic fundamentals to get started you
4:46
just need a zoom connection and an
4:49
ability to want to reach out to people
4:51
for me it started with sending DMS to
4:54
the people that I was interested in and
4:56
what people don't realize when they're
4:58
starting a podcast is they underestimate
5:01
the amount of people who will say yes to
5:03
them there are more people who will come
5:04
on your podcast than you probably
5:06
imagine just send 100 messages and
5:09
really be interested in a wide range of
5:11
people and you might be rejecting
5:13
yourself before you actually are even
5:15
sending the message so yeah send more
5:17
messages is my tip for people who are
Tools & equipment
5:19
just starting out and then in terms of
5:20
tools and equipment you might need what
5:22
does that look like so I think you can
5:25
start with a sure mv7 and a zoom
5:28
connection and you can get it done just
5:31
with that alone you can upload on anchor
5:33
which is free which I use to this day it
5:36
doesn't cost much what costs is the
5:38
effort that it takes to build the
5:40
podcast yeah I see you as one of the
How to become a great interviewer
5:42
best podcast interviews at least in my
5:44
experience how do you become a great
5:47
interviewer for me it's about putting
5:49
care and attention on the other person
5:50
and that starts with the research
5:52
process so in the research process I
5:55
will try to spend five to twenty hours
5:56
of podcast episodes Googling their name
5:59
Twitter Instagram really stalking the
6:02
hell out of them being my own private
6:04
investigator so I can spend so much time
6:06
with them that I can live in their shoes
6:07
so I can get context for the things to
6:09
ask them and the best questions give
6:12
people a new insight or a new aha to oh
6:16
that's why I've been acting that way or
6:18
oh that's why I did a certain thing so
6:20
I'm aiming to give people interesting
6:23
experiences about their own life by
6:25
shaping the way in which they think
How to get your first guest
6:27
about themselves all right Dana you've
6:28
had a ton of amazing guests on your
6:30
podcast how did you get your first guest
6:32
and how do you get amazing guests so the
6:34
first guest I would recommend going to a
6:36
friend somebody you already feel
6:38
comfortable with and somebody you're
6:39
excited to talk to and do that for 10
6:42
episodes try to connect and actually be
6:45
interested in the guests but also have
6:47
the guests be interested in you that
6:49
eases some of the pressure off who was
6:51
my first amazing guest that was Gary
6:53
vaynerchuk episode 39 and that idea of
6:56
him coming on the show was so out of
6:59
left field and so unexpected but it gave
7:01
me a lot of confidence to know that I
7:04
could talk to him and he could have a
7:05
great conversation from it so I think
7:07
that how do you get amazing guests you
7:09
need to hack their attention how do you
7:11
hack their attention you use the
7:13
platforms that they spend the most time
7:14
on and you give them value in some way
7:17
that could be in ways they've impacted
7:19
your life that could be sending them
7:21
interesting messages that could be with
7:23
an interesting subject line or something
7:25
unexpected but you need to figure out a
7:27
way to hack people's attention if you
7:29
want to get amazing guests
How to land big guests
7:33
[Music]
7:37
in terms of getting good guests their
7:39
Outreach side of things what do you tell
7:41
people use Twitter Twitter is the most
7:44
untapped resource there is for getting
7:47
guests and I think it's because the most
7:49
thoughtful people in the world are on
7:51
Twitter and everyone checks their
7:52
mentions
7:53
and I've been public about I think a lot
7:57
of people are scared to tweet out
8:00
at this person I would love to have you
8:02
on my podcast or I would love to have
8:04
you on my YouTube show they're they're
8:06
scared because they don't want to be
8:07
rejected right or publicly rejected at
8:09
that and I've always been comfortable
8:11
with let me just throw this out there
8:13
the odds of them saying yes to come on
8:16
the show are very low but if they do
8:18
that's a home run yeah that's how I got
8:19
Gary vaynerchuk for episode 39 of the
8:22
podcast I got it because I just tweeted
8:24
he was one of my dream guests and then I
8:27
put out a screenshot of a blog post that
8:29
I wrote about him in 2009 and then he
8:32
followed me and then I tweeted that he
8:33
followed me and then people said in the
8:35
comments and the replies to me tweeting
8:37
that he followed me people telling him
8:39
that he should come on the podcast and
8:41
then he did so I've used Twitter really
8:43
effectively I think to help get amazing
8:46
guests on the show that I otherwise
8:47
wouldn't have been able to get yeah hey

alright enjoy the rest of the video with

Danny peace all right let's talk about
Marketing Strategy
9:43
marketing it's easy to start a podcast a
9:45
lot of people start it but usually find
9:47
the hardest thing to do is to get people
9:50
to listen to it how have you approached
9:52
marketing uh when you started and also
9:54
today so a lot of people think that if
9:57
they have an amazing Big Time guest that
9:59
is going to bring in new listeners
10:00
that's not enough the marketing is
10:03
something you have to do you have to
10:04
grow the show you have to take a big
10:06
concept and you have to chop it down
10:08
into things that people will want to
10:11
watch in short Snippets that might not
10:13
know who you are tap into a bigger
10:15
conversation right so let's say we have
10:17
a podcast and we talk about
10:20
entrepreneurship entrepreneurship is a
10:22
bigger conversation than Danny Miranda
10:24
or Pat walls tapping into bigger
10:26
conversations is really how you grow the
10:28
podcast because people might not be
10:30
interested in either of us but they'll
10:32
be interested in the bigger conversation
Clip & Content Schedule
10:34
of Entrepreneurship and tell me a little
10:36
bit more about that marketing strategy
10:37
looks like you how many Clips are you
10:38
posting a day and what does that look
10:40
like so on YouTube we're posting at
10:43
least one video Everything single day so
10:45
that's a full length video or a video
10:47
that's over one minute long every single
10:49
day we'll also post at least two shorts
10:52
on YouTube every single day we'll also
10:54
post at least three Instagram reels
10:56
every single day and we'll have at least
10:58
five Twitter clips from our show every
11:00
day so if you think about how much
11:02
content is getting distributed how many
11:04
conversations are getting started
11:05
because of this podcast it's insane head
11:08
not to make someone feel bad who's just
11:09
getting started if they're in your first
11:11
day your first iteration just focus on
11:13
what you can control I built up to that
11:15
process but now I have an editor on the
11:18
team but when you're just getting
11:19
started focus on the most important part
11:21
which is the conversation there's a lot
How to build a unique podcast
11:23
of podcasts out there and a lot of them
11:25
go unnoticed how do you stand out as a
11:27
podcast you care
11:29
you care more than other people and that
11:32
means caring about the clips that you
11:34
put out caring about the guests giving
11:35
the guests a good experience and doing
11:37
everything you can to care more than the
11:40
other person if everyone has a podcast
11:42
the person who cares the most about
11:43
their podcasts and their guests are
11:46
gonna win long term yeah but if you can
11:48
also go a different route you could also
11:49
Care More by having a specific Niche
11:52
that you want to focus on I know there
11:54
are people who have been successful by
11:56
having the marketing show or by having
11:57
the entrepreneurship podcast or by doing
12:00
a slight tweak on something that people
12:02
don't want to discuss call her daddy by
12:04
Alex Cooper succeeded because she talked
12:07
about a topic that was Taboo in the
12:09
mainstream but that she was able to use
12:12
and navigate through if all of that goes
12:14
to say you can be a niche and succeed or
12:17
you could be yourself and succeed
12:18
regardless you have to care a lot about
12:20
the person on the other end as well as
12:23
the audience when you are thinking about
12:25
growing the podcast
Staying consistent
12:26
[Music]
12:27
foreign
12:29
[Music]
12:34
let's talk about consistency and you've
12:37
done 359 episodes in two and a half
12:39
years really haven't missed a day if you
12:42
think about it tell me about your
12:43
approach to consistency I put out three
12:46
episodes a week because I I understood
12:48
and reverse engineered Joe Rogan Joe
12:50
Rogan has put out three episodes a week
12:52
for 10 years I've put out three episodes
12:54
a week for two and a half years so what
12:57
is that going to mean it's not going to
12:58
mean that at the end of 10 years I will
13:00
be Joe Rogan what it means at the end of
13:02
10 years I will be better at
13:04
communicating my thoughts and asking
13:05
questions and really that's what I'm
13:07
trying to do with the podcast so the
13:09
consistency is helpful to help me be a
13:12
better communicator and I look at each
13:14
episode as going to the gym it's like
13:16
showing up even when you don't feel like
13:17
it it's not like I'm sitting there so
13:19
excited every single moment of every day
13:22
but I know that it's helping me lay a
13:23
brick to be better tell me a little bit
Daily routines & habits
13:25
about your routine I know you like
13:27
routines and you're into meditation tell
13:29
me more about that because I think it's
13:30
amazing what you did thanks man I mean I
13:33
think meditation and having presence is
13:36
the key for being a successful podcaster
13:38
it's very difficult to do what I do
13:41
asking questions listening really being
13:43
with somebody if you haven't first been
13:45
with yourself as deeply as you can
13:47
connect with someone as deep as you
13:49
affect yourself so medication is a key
13:50
part of that going on walks going
13:53
outside in the morning just to hear the
13:55
birds chirp right it's just like
13:56
something I love doing for 10 minutes
13:58
and it's such a subtle thing but it just
14:00
reinforces wow like life is great and
14:03
like I can be present in this moment
14:05
when quote unquote nothing's happening
14:07
as well as Fitness I wouldn't be the
14:09
podcaster I am today without spending a
14:11
lot of time in the gym that's the
14:13
consistency piece of it and also
14:15
spending a lot of time with my own
14:17
thoughts and thinking about how do I
14:19
view the world and what are the topics
14:21
and messages that I want to promote
14:22
through this podcast yeah if you could

Transcript:
Intro
0:00
what if I told you you could turn this
0:01
blank Google doc into millions of
0:04
dollars well that's what thousands of
0:06
people are doing right now on the
0:08
internet but nobody's talking about it
0:10
so I found someone who would Alex Garcia
0:13
a kid from Austin Texas who makes eight
0:15
hundred thousand dollars a year writing
0:17
five different email newsletters he
0:19
invited me into his house and broke down
0:21
everything including a step-by-step
0:23
blueprint anyone can use to build a
0:25
six-figured newsletter from scratch if
0:27
you have those four things you have just
0:29
about everything you need to run a
0:30
successful newsletter we also broke down
0:32
how to find the right Niche how to get
0:34
advertisers to pay you thousands of
0:35
dollars and the fastest way to get your
0:38
first 10 000 subscribers and from that
0:40
time frame I went from 2000 Subs to like
0:43
eight or nine thousand Subs I think you
0:45
could build a nine figure company with
0:47
newsletters
0:49
thank you
The Business Model + Revenue
0:52
hey welcome to Texas thank you good to
0:55
see you yeah welcome in thank you all
0:57
right Alex here we've got one of the
0:59
coolest jobs on the internet can you
1:00
tell me a little bit about yourself and
1:02
what you do
1:03
um lucky enough that I get to honestly
1:04
research a bunch of dope content about
1:06
you know a bunch of marketing campaigns
1:07
and get to write newsletters about it so
1:09
we have marketing exam which is the
1:11
biggest one we have content examine
1:13
social examine landing page examine and
1:15
now DTC examine all in all it's like 150
1:17
160 000 total subscribers driving right
1:19
now roughly in the range of like 65k to
1:22
70k a monthly Revenue all from ad
1:24
sponsors and then on the other end it's
1:25
like the products that I'm telling you
1:27
I'm testing right now it's going to be
1:28
spun into a product that's bringing in
1:30
15 to 20K but my whole life my whole
1:32
career revolves around content how did
Finding the idea
1:34
you come up with the idea to build
1:35
newsletters I was a huge fan of the
1:37
hustle and I saw that they actually had
1:38
a job opening so I applied for it
1:39
because I knew I wanted to be in that
1:41
space I wanted to understand how to grow
1:43
a newsletter how to scale a media
1:45
company and so I applied for a position
1:46
at the hospital and I got in and when I
1:48
got to the hustle I gave myself one year
1:50
two months probably before I left I
1:52
really started going you could say like
1:53
hard on Twitter like making that my
1:55
primary channel of distribution and
1:57
started building up the the newsletter
1:58
kind of tweaking messing with different
2:00
ideas of what the content is what the
2:03
content isn't once I kind of got that
2:04
then the idea was okay I love hbr I love
2:07
Harvard Business Review how do I take
2:08
that idea and that concept and bring it
2:11
to marketing and then scale that into
Building a 9-figure newsletter
2:13
marketing and examine let's talk about
2:14
the opportunity of newsletters some
2:16
people might see a newsletter and think
2:18
oh that's a small business what are the
2:19
numbers here in terms of what you can
2:21
really build with the newsletter to me
2:23
it's how creative you want to get with
2:24
it morning Brew expanded into 15 20
2:26
different Publications and sold for a
2:28
part of the company for 75 million cash
2:30
they're now doing over 100 million in
2:32
Revenue the hustle I was even there and
2:34
I don't know the final number but I'm
2:35
guessing in the range of 20 to 30
2:37
million off of one newsletter in a paid
2:39
product I think you could build it in a
2:41
nine figure company with newsletters
2:42
especially in the B2B space the part
2:44
that nobody talks about with newsletters
2:46
is top of funnel for anything else you
2:48
want to build if you want to launch an
2:49
agency it is top of funnel for you
2:51
agency if it works in congruency with
2:53
your newsletter the potential is endless
2:54
there's so many different things you can
How to find a niche
2:56
write about yeah
2:57
foreign
2:59
[Music]
3:00
newsletter how did you go about finding
3:04
your Niche and what would you recommend
3:06
others to look for what topic to write
3:07
about yeah so I think there's two ways
3:09
to skin the cat there right like the
3:11
first one I think about is if you want
3:12
to write about something that you love
3:13
that's one way to find the niche right
3:15
like what on your downtime find yourself
3:17
reading and wanting to do research about
3:19
or already writing about it I think the
3:21
second is if you are more money driven
3:24
you're just like want to start a
3:25
business and sell it what is the topic
3:27
that's exploding right now what is the
3:28
thing that people are talking about
3:29
right now that you can start a business
3:31
in for me it was what did I love reading
3:33
about what did I love talking about what
3:35
did I love researching about those three
3:37
things and it all came down to marketing
3:39
and content and Building Things right
3:41
that's how I found what I wanted to
3:42
write about hey real quick that business
3:44
you want to start let me show you how
3:45
you can make your first dollar online 10
3:47
times faster by using case studies and
3:49
as you could read the exact steps to how
3:52
someone built a million dollar business
3:53
and the mistakes they made so you can
3:55
avoid them when you launch well at
3:57
starter store we have a library of over
3:58
4 000 case studies and business idea
4:00
breakdowns where you can do this all
4:02
backed by real data for example Loop
4:04
joint starter story and dove into our
4:06
case study about a newsletter that makes
4:08
25 million dollars a year just one month
4:10
later he launched his own newsletter and
4:12
did 5 800 in Revenue in 30 days it's
4:15
simple he studied what works implemented
4:18
it and avoided the mistakes of people
4:19
that were just a few steps ahead of him
4:21
if you're serious about building a
4:22
business head to starterstory.com Alex
4:24
it's only one dollar for seven days and
4:27
I'll leave a link in the top of the
4:28
description much love hope you guys
4:29
enjoy the rest of the video peace let's
4:31
talk about how you get your first few
Blueprint for first 1,000 subscribers
4:33
subscribers how do you get your first
4:35
100 or 1 000 subscribers on a newsletter
4:37
yeah so this is something I learned from
4:39
Noah Kagan and it's this idea of like
4:40
Hanahan combat when you're trying to get
4:42
your first 100 subscribers your first
4:43
thousand subscribers you do the things
4:45
that aren't you can't really scale and
4:47
so you're reaching out to people telling
4:49
that you that you have a newsletter
4:51
right you're dming people on LinkedIn
4:53
you're dming people on Twitter Instagram
4:54
you're getting friends to push it you're
4:57
doing little giveaways like you're
4:58
finding this small things that adds 10
5:00
subscribers 15 subscribers right second
5:03
thing I would do is what we call is like
5:05
Buffet marketing the idea of like you
5:06
walk into Golden Corral and you see all
5:09
this food you're like man I got 20 bucks
5:10
and I got all this food right now I'm
5:12
about to get all these plates and I'm
5:14
gonna try all this and then what I
5:16
like I'm gonna go back for and it's like
5:18
what has the potential to 10x finding
5:20
those things that have the 10x potential
5:21
and then honing in on like the one or
5:23
two things that always are driving
5:24
growth if I was trying to start from
5:27
scratch again I would start first with
5:28
Hannah hand combat then Buffet marketing
5:31
then I would optimize scale and continue
5:34
refining it yeah this hand-to-hand
The outreach method
5:36
combat what specifically does that look
5:37
like that's going on your Facebook page
5:39
right you have 500 to 800 friends on
5:42
Facebook that you never go on there that
5:43
would actually click a link and
5:44
subscribe something and support you
5:46
right for me you know one of the things
5:47
that I did at the beginning was I wrote
5:49
50 marketing threads over 50 days so
5:51
every day I was publishing a marketing
5:52
content specifically a Twitter thread
5:54
and from that time frame I went from it
5:56
was like 500 followers on Twitter to 40
5:58
000. in between that I grew my
6:00
newsletter from I think it was like 2
6:02
000 Subs to like eight or nine thousand
6:03
Subs all right let's talk about how to
Finding interesting topics
6:05
find good content to write about and
6:07
content that will keep people subscribed
6:09
and coming back for more one way you can
6:11
do it is you can use a tool where you
6:13
can put in a certain topic and it will
6:16
give you the most shared articles on the
6:18
internet about a certain topic Twitter
6:19
advanced search is another great way if
6:21
you could understand how to use the
6:23
filters and use advanced search just to
6:25
find like hidden gems that nobody talks
6:27
about right like you could put different
6:29
keywords in Twitter and find like in my
6:32
case like that marketing campaigns no
6:34
one known as ever covered let's talk
How to monetize
6:36
about monetizing a newsletter how do
6:37
newsletters make money and how are your
6:39
newsletters making money right now the
6:41
simplest way to monetize a newsletter is
6:42
via sponsorships that is going out and
6:45
finding somebody that wants to to get in
6:47
front of your audience you've built
6:49
distribution you've created trust with
6:51
your audience people want a piece of
6:53
that so think of your newsletter as
6:55
Facebook ads as Instagram has as Tick
6:57
Tock ads where you have the reach you
7:00
have the potential for a return on ad
7:01
spend so now how do I get people to want
7:03
to pay money to get in front of that
7:05
group the other way is a paid newsletter
7:07
I don't know if you're familiar with
7:08
Lenny's newsletter that is another great
7:10
way of monetizing your newsletter where
7:12
he has the free newsletter that works as
7:14
top of funnel for his paid newsletter
7:16
that he charges I think like 8.99 or
7:18
like 10.99 for or it's more exclusive
7:20
content I mean specifically right now we
7:22
monetizing in two ways the the first way
7:25
is through sponsorships the second way
7:27
is through Services which is the testing
7:29
grounds for a product that we're going
7:31
to be launching in Q3
Tools
7:33
foreign
7:36
what tools do you use to run a
7:38
newsletter business all right so there's
7:39
four primary tools that I use and like
7:41
this is the core of the of the company
7:42
it's zapier it is notion it is slack and
7:46
is an ESP if you have those four things
7:48
you have just about everything you need
7:50
to run a successful newsletter you have
7:52
zapier which connects everything you
7:54
have notion which controls everything
7:55
you have slack to communicate with
7:58
everyone and you have your ESP which
8:00
sends the emails out to everybody so you
Outsourcing writers
8:02
have five newsletters do you write all
8:03
the content yourself so I hired writers
8:05
now for marketing the exam and there's a
8:07
writer for each Niche tell you kind of a
8:09
tip for finding a good writer search a
8:11
very Niche topic on Google and then go
8:14
on to like Pages two three four like
8:16
just deep into the archive of Google
8:17
read some of these people's content that
8:20
is such a place to find great writers it
8:22
is a difficult thing to find good
8:24
writers but you can find a good writer
8:26
do everything you can to keep them and
How to grow a newsletter
8:28
entertain them have you grown your
8:29
newsletter first one is content
8:31
marketing and it has been using my
8:33
Twitter to really grow the newsletter
8:34
and being able to find like what are the
8:36
growth pieces of content what are the
8:38
pieces of content that the algorithm
8:39
favors and will push and then the last
8:42
year and a half that has been Twitter
8:43
thread so being able to use Twitter
8:44
threads and segue people to the
8:46
newsletter the second one has been paid
8:47
acquisition so that's running Facebook
8:49
ads Instagram ads Tick Tock ads Reddit
8:51
like all you know testing all the
8:53
different acquisition channels I'll try
8:55
all sorts of different ctas on my
8:56
Twitter threads whatever works there is
8:58
then the basis for a lot of things I'll
9:00
do on Pace and then the third is this is
9:02
newer it's a lot of platforms like spark
9:04
Loop a lot of platforms like beehive are
9:07
now in convertkit they give you a
9:08
scalable way of having cross promotions
9:11
so where you can set a budget of ten
9:13
thousand dollars a month and then
9:14
piggybacking off somebody else's content
9:16
yeah or somebody else's newsletter and
9:17
grow so those have been the three main
9:19
acquisition channels we talked about the
9:20
growth side of how you find readers how
9:23
do you find advertisers who will pay you
9:24
money to sponsor your newsletters
9:26
there's two ways you want to develop how
9:27
can you get people to want to sponsor
Finding advertisers & pricing
9:29
you that are readers and then the other
9:31
way is outbound the way I want to do it
9:33
with with inbound traffic or with
9:35
inbound sponsors is having the
9:37
newsletter and having a very easy way
9:38
for people that want to sponsor the
9:39
newsletter to be able to sponsor the
9:40
newsletter the second way is the
9:42
outbound process all the newsletters in
9:44
your Niche that already have advertisers
9:45
and find those advertisers and reach out
9:47
to those advertisers right like these
9:49
are already people spending money on
9:51
newsletters primarily comes down to
9:52
courtly mailing say newsletter has 10
9:54
000 subscribers how much could you sell
9:56
an ad stop for if you have 10 000 Subs
9:58
you could sell anything for over a
9:59
thousand dollars and people will pay for
10:01
it to get in front of 10 000 people that
10:03
is your direct audience I mean I'd pay a
10:05
thousand dollars for that
How to get better at marketing
10:07
[Music]
10:09
all right you're a world-class marketer
10:11
you run a business about marketing
10:12
what's your advice on how to become a
10:14
better marketer one you want to find
10:16
somebody that is where you want to go
10:19
and you want to learn from them the
10:20
second thing is build things like Tinker
10:23
build actual products launch things try
10:25
to figure out how you can get your
10:27
product to a thousand dollars or drive a
10:29
thousand dollars in sales or whatever
10:30
the third thing is you have to be not so
10:32
data driven and like intuition driven
10:34
and I know you're super into fitness
Daily routine
10:36
tell me about your daily routine and
10:39

Advice for new entrepreneurs

Intro
0:00
the internet has created a new
0:01
opportunity if you can write like a
0:03
fifth grader you can make millions and I
0:06
just found living proof this is Mason an
0:09
average kid who went from earning ten
0:10
dollars an hour packing boxes to making
0:12
2.3 million dollars by the age of 21 all

0:23
learned was insane with a laptop and a
0:26
lot of hustle he taught himself

all the way to 48k a month in my peak in
0:38
this video we're going to dive deep into
0:39
his business and show you exactly what
0:41
it takes to become a world-class
0:42
copywriter and we'll cover what I think
0:45
is the number one secret to why Masons
0:47
made Millions
0:48
of people are using this model to make
0:50
money it's the way better way to go I'm
0:53
Pat walls and this is starter story
Meet Starter Story
1:00
who are you guys or starter story
1:02
starters we're here to unveil your scam
1:05
operation
1:08
it I know this is about the legit
1:10
business this is about the scam yeah
1:11
yeah this is the crib all right man good
1:13
to meet you give us a breakdown of who
Who is Cardinal Mason
1:16
Cardinal Mason is and everything you've
1:17
built I was a 21 year old College
1:19
Dropout they got into freelance
1:21
copywriting fell in love with it
1:22
basically at First Sight loved it so
1:24
much that I grew it all the way to 48k a
1:26
month in my Peak wasn't sustainable but
1:28
I did anyway I rolled that into building
1:31
an agency email marketing agency that
1:33
did multiple six figures a year I wanted
1:35
to share more about my journey of being
1:37
a copywriter because I think it's
1:38
something that anyone can do so I turned
1:40
it into a program an education company
1:42
like we did a milli in 96 days I want to
1:46
make as many people very wealthy as I
1:48
possibly can what exactly is copywriting
What is copywriting
1:50
uh why is it so important right so
1:52
copywriting is on a high level it's
1:54
writing marketing materials for
1:56
companies so anything that's spoken or
1:59
posted on Instagram or posted on
2:01
Facebook or in an email or in a text
2:02
message you get it's written by a
2:04
copywriter so like basically all of the
2:06
communications going from business to
2:08
the consumer is written by a copywriter
2:11
and the better that that communication
2:13
is the more money you're going to make
2:15
the more people are going to like you
2:16
the more people are going to come back
2:17
and spend more money not just like the
2:19
first customer or the first touch but
2:21
like every other touch after that and so
2:23
a good copywriter is is basically like
2:26
the the messenger from the company to
2:28
the world everyone's like okay wait well
2:30
like which company doesn't have that
2:31
you'd be surprised it blew my mind to
2:33
learn how many business owners like
2:35
don't have that or know how to do it
2:37
themselves I hear that AI is going to
2:40
kill copywriting can you tell me about
2:41
the opportunity of copywriting the
2:43
reality is the AI is good and it's but
2:46
it's a tool people need to understand
2:48
it's like AI does not just instantly
2:50
know what to do what to write AI is a
2:52
tool that copywriters can use to write
2:54
better write clear think better have
2:56
more ideas like just more Concepts but
2:58
the reason someone's hiring a copy is
3:00
because they don't even know where to
3:01
start right like a lot of business
3:02
owners like it's not that they don't
3:03
have time or that they just need someone
3:05
to do it it's usually like because they
3:07
need someone to like think on their
3:08
behalf AI can't do that yet and so for
3:10
now for AI to actually give you good
3:13
solid copy that's gonna convert and make
3:16
people like want to hear more from you
3:17
it has to be written by a real
3:19
copywriter first like any prompts that
3:21
AI gets has to be from someone who
3:23
fundamentally understands copywriting
3:25
like the opportunity here is that there
3:27
are 35 million businesses small
3:29
businesses in the us alone there's about
3:31
45 to 5 000 freelance copywriters in
3:36
America so for it to be saturated every
3:38
single copywriter would have to have
3:39
like 3 000 clients and you only need
3:42
four or five six clients to make really
3:44
solid money like six figures like
3:46
everyone is really lazy and so if you
3:48
think that like if I get a video talking
3:50
about copywriting and it has a hundred
3:51
thousand views for any 100 000 views
3:53
that I get there's probably another five
3:55
people that are actually trying it yeah
3:57
and four of them are going to give up in
3:58
like in a month yeah so like if you
4:01
actually genuinely want to work then
4:03
there's more than enough to go around
How I got my first client
4:05
you're out of college you're trying to
4:06
figure out how to make money online tell
4:07
us about how you got first client how
4:09
did that work scroll through constantly
4:11
just like looking for any type of
4:12
company that like would hire me I got
4:15
one a music blog they made no money I
4:18
think they posted the rate was like 1.5
4:20
cents a word which means for a thousand
4:22
words I get 15 so that's like actual
4:25
like minimum wage I kind of gave myself
4:28
a pep talk and I was like all right if
4:29
I'm gonna if I'm gonna do this let's
4:30
let's do it right but like it can't just
4:32
Google companies that will pay me to
4:34
write copy for them like you can't
4:35
there's no search for that so I went to
4:37
Instagram I would just wait for ads so I
4:39
would like scroll through every like
4:40
three or four posts on Instagram would
4:43
be an ad and so I eventually found a
4:45
bunch of companies using that I figure
4:46
out who the founder is and then figure
4:48
out what their email is and then I would
4:49
just send them a cold email say I got a
4:51
response saying hey Mason thanks for
4:52
reaching out I'd love to get on a call
4:53
and talk about what this would look like
4:54
so I ended up getting on the call I took
4:56
it way too seriously I probably could
4:57
have been more chill and I dressed up
4:58
like I asked my mom I was like should I
5:00
wear a tie and she's like I don't know I
5:02
think it might be a little bit too much
5:03
he was like all right emails ads blogs
5:05
they wanted kind of everything for me
5:07
and he was like what would you charge
5:08
for that and I was like 2500 bucks a
5:10
month and he was like all right to me
5:11
bro like that was like a year of income
5:13
for me I felt like I like snuck in
5:15
somewhere and I was like that is
5:17
imposter syndrome hey real quick that
5:19
business you want to start let me show
5:21
you how you can make your first dollar

6:02

6:04
rest of the video peace as a copywriter
How to get good at copywriting
6:06
one of the most useful tools okay so the
6:09
cool thing about being a copywriter is
6:10
like you don't really need much I I've
6:12
always said that like the bare minimum
6:14
that you can do copyrighting with is
6:15
like 40 bucks right so if you have 40
6:17
bucks to spend congrats you can be
6:19
pretty much copyright like it's domain
6:21
and a website so domain off Google
6:22
demands website off card I know people
6:24
that will do it without a website I
6:26
don't recommend it I use mail track you
6:29
can see people's interactions with your
6:30
email you send them one-on-one like if
6:32
they open it or forward it or something
6:34
right 100.io is good just to figure out
6:37
like who people like what their email is
6:39
so I mean yeah dude there's not not
6:41
really much in it all right so you're
6:43
probably one of the best copywriters in
6:44
the world whether you like to admit it
6:45
or not I don't know at least one of the
6:47
fastest what would be your advice to
6:50
people that want to get good fast at
6:51
copywriting I mean to get good fast like
6:53
you just have to write so much like when
6:55
I was at my best was when I was like I
6:57
said kind of just cracked out just
6:59
writing for eight hours a day straight
7:01
um again that's not realistic for a lot
7:03
of people like some people have jobs
7:04
immerse yourself in the world of
7:06
whatever you're trying to do so like I
7:07
was reading a lot of copy I was writing
7:10
a lot of copy I was like editing a lot
7:12
of copy for like some of my teammates I
7:14
was you know listening to podcasts about
7:16
marketing I was watching YouTube videos
7:17
on it like dude it was all I did just
7:19
have to force yourself to be fast if you
7:21
give someone 10 hours to do a task it's
7:23
gonna take them 10 hours but if you give
7:24
them one hour it'll take about an hour
7:25
and so that's what you realize where
7:27
it's like you you will just continually
7:29
keep adding clients and you think that
7:31
if you're currently working 40 hours a
7:32
week with like three clients and you add
7:34
one more then it's gonna be like 50
7:35
hours a week but it's not you're just
7:36
gonna my way to squish that in you think
7:38
your garbage is full you think your
7:39
garbage can is full and you push it down
7:40
and realize that it's only like 25 full
7:42
it sounds like the well the network was
7:44
a big thing for you meeting meeting uh
7:46
Chase who is well connected in the
7:48
copywriting space tell me a little bit
7:49
more about that building your network
7:50
Chase had just had a baby and so he
7:52
wasn't actually actively working in the
7:54
business he was working like on the
7:55
business like just trying to do Legion
7:56
get clients in but I knew Chase was like
7:58
an influencer like I followed him on
8:00
Twitter and he was tar and he was famous
8:01
to me I I got one of the team members to
8:03
give me his address and I went in and
8:05
made like a custom onesie for his
8:07
daughter on the front of the onesie it
8:08
said email marketing is dead and then
8:10
crossed out it said Dad email marketing
8:12
is Dad and he put it on his daughter he
8:14
was like dude who did this and then
8:15
someone eventually told him like Mason
8:17
did that and so that started like the
8:19
the relationship and the interaction I
8:21
was I told him I was like dude like
8:22
listen like you know not trying to pump
8:23
your tires or anything but like I'm a
8:25
fan and like I think I could help you a
8:27
lot so like if there's anything you need
8:28
you let me know and I'll just write it
8:30
like blogs emails tweets like I'll do
8:32
whatever kind of cool like how like he
8:33
hired he gave me one of my first gigs
8:35
like he gave me a shot yeah
How freelancing translated into a bigger business
8:37
[Music]
8:41
now tell me about how your experience
8:43
freelancing in those first few years has
8:46
now translated into this bigger business
8:48
that is I guess a derivative of this
8:51
hard work that you put in those days can
8:53
you tell me about that and then what
8:54
those businesses look like today you're
8:56
probably not going to be a freelancer
8:57
for like the rest of your life like some
8:59
people can do that if that's like what
9:00
they want to do but like what I see a
9:02
lot is people will sort of reach the top
9:04
of like freelancer income which is
9:06
around 30 to 40K a month but like if you
9:08
want to get to like 100 200 500k a month
9:10
like you kind of have to build something
9:11
else because you have to hire people you
9:13
have to learn new skills you have to
9:14
like learn more about fulfillment you
9:16
have to become an operator like it's all
9:17
kinds of different skills instead of
9:19
just like trying to like squeeze as much
9:21
juice as they can out of being a
9:22
freelancer they'll usually work with
9:24
like a couple dozen companies over the
9:25
course of like two or three years that
9:27
they're doing it but with those people
9:28
they'll learn from them what they're
9:30
doing so like I work with a lot of
9:31
agencies I work with a lot of info guys
9:33
I work with a lot of e-commerce Brands I
9:34
kind of have my pick I was like I know
9:35
how all these businesses kind of work I
9:37
really like the idea of an agency and so
9:39
like that was why I chose to go from
9:41
freelancing agency and it made it way
9:43
easier for me to learn how to do that I
9:45
still have a couple freelance clients
9:46
that I still work with just because I
9:47
need to stay sharp I still write for
9:49
Chase like I still like do some stuff
9:50
for him I have a series called Alex in
9:52
my inbox with him I know that actually
9:53
yeah so everyone kind of knows at this
9:55
point like I'm Alex that's awesome I
9:57
didn't know that you didn't know that I
9:57
didn't know that was you yeah that's me
9:58
that's awesome my main sole Focus the
10:02
only thing that I genuinely like want to
10:04
grow and get the only thing I care about
10:05
is copy NBA I think it's the best
10:07
opportunity to make an impact on my
10:10
audience I think I can make a big impact
10:12
with the people that choose to be part
10:13
of my team and we have an opportunity to
10:15
hit some stupid numbers you were in this
10:17
space where you're making a few thousand
10:18
with your freelancing work some people
10:20
watching this might also be working as a
10:22
freelancer and trying to take it to that
10:23
next level like you did so what would be
10:25
your advice to people to go from small
10:27
time freelancer to Big Time like what
10:29
you're doing it's such a silly mistake
10:31
basically what people do is they don't
10:33
understand that they can get like
10:34
recurring sort of like agency style
10:35
retainers two three four four grand a
10:37
month to work with a client and they
10:39
just do these one-off gigs and they
10:40
write 100 product description and they
10:42
get paid a thousand dollars to do it and
10:43
then they're on the chase for the next
10:44
client obviously that's not the right
10:46
way to go you don't need to do that
10:47
hundreds thousands of people are using
10:49
this model to make money it's the way
10:51
better way to go like if you're only
10:52
doing like one email a week and they're
10:54
paying you 800 bucks a month like I'd
10:56
say that's probably kind of fair like
10:57
you should do more stuff provide value
10:59
dude like that's all you have to do all
11:01
right what does a day in the life look
11:02
like for you dude my days are very like
11:06
poor I wake up late around like nine I
11:10
usually stay in bed until like 9 45 I'll
11:13
walk to the coffee shop get a coffee say
11:15
what's up go back upstairs lock in
11:16
usually I'll start the day writing
11:18
something just to like get in the groove
11:19
I think it's a good habit to like write
11:21
every morning gets the brain flowing a
11:23
little bit so yeah I'll write an email
11:25
on my list or you know a long messaging
11:27
slack to my students or like some of my
11:29
team or something something usually on
11:31
calls in the morning because I have a
11:32
lot of energy and I can talk about stuff
11:33
most of it is content too so I'll
11:35
probably go live once or twice I'll make
11:37
a video yeah for tick tock usually just
11:38
like talking to students or being on
11:40
Tick Tock like that's all my job really
11:41
is I go to the gym but like I'm super
11:44
under optimized I like to walk around
11:45
like I like to get eight to ten thousand
11:47
steps a day solid feels good and at this
11:50
point my team is big enough where I can
11:51
kind of just like think of stuff and
11:52
then be like Abby do this or Ali do this
11:55
or Griff do this or Ben do this whoever
11:56
is in charge of that thing will just
11:58
like take it and run with it and I'm
11:59
just like sit with my aquapona all right
12:02
well the last question we ask for all
12:04
entrepreneurs is if you could go back
12:06
and sit on Mason's shoulder will be some
12:09
things that you would tell him that
12:10
you've learned along the way don't
12:12
procrastinate who's as a big one don't
12:14
be afraid of what you think is going to
12:16
happen just try it and see like
12:17
nothing's ever that bad like you're
12:18
never gonna make a decision that
12:19
completely just derails everything and
12:21
the grand scheme of things is never that
12:22
big of a deal I made a lot of mistakes
12:24
obviously as everyone does in the early
12:25
days but I would never change anything
12:27
the regret of sending the wrong message
12:29
to a client or Prospect the regret of
12:31
you know working with someone that I
12:32
probably shouldn't have worked with like
12:34
every single thing that I've done has
12:35
led to this exact moment which I'm I'm
12:38
happy that we're here I like hanging out
12:40
with you so I wouldn't change anything
12:42
it makes the L's really easy to handle
12:44
when you have the mindset of in 10 years
12:46
I'll never regret anything that I'm
12:47
doing right now every yeah every mistake
12:49
you make is going to end up being all
12:50
right all right
12:52
thank you sir thank you man follow these
12:55
steps and you'll be a multi-millionaire
12:56
copywriter overnight it takes no work
12:59
you don't have to do anything

Show: Starter Story
Host: Pat Walls
Aired: Mar 27, 2023
In this video, I flew out to Chicago to meet Hunter Hammonds - the guy who's on a mission to build a 12 $1,000,000 businesses in 12 months. He shared everything about the method he's using to do it, how he's scaling so fast, and how the productized service is acting as a launchpad for an even bigger vision. Hope you guys get some inspiration from this!
Transcript:
Intro
0:00
this is Hunter hammett's he's launched
0:02
four million dollar businesses in the
0:04
last four months all of them productized
0:06
services that use essentially the same
0:08
strategy I flew out to Chicago to meet
0:10
him and he broke down each of his
0:11
businesses as well as the method he's
0:13
using to launch a million dollar
0:14
business every 30 days really what we're
0:17
doing at the end of the day is just
0:18
talking to our friends and seeing if it
0:20
makes sense for us to build a business
0:21
together but Hunter's journey is not
0:24
some lucky overnight success story he
0:26
started and failed multiple businesses
0:28
over the last 15 years just decided like
0:30
it's time to take a break and burned out
0:32
now Hunter's goal is to build 12 million
0:35
dollar businesses in 12 months and then
0:37
turn those businesses into a cash
0:39
flowing machine so we can build
0:40

across the board like each of these
1:14
businesses is just delivering incredible
1:16
work to its customers so it feels pretty
1:18
special can you break down each of the
1:20
businesses that you've built sure most
1:22
recently we launched hey friends which
1:24
is our done for you YouTube agency with
1:26
Ali abdal another is off menu which is
1:28
our full service design agency we have
1:30
viral cuts which is our high-end premium
1:32
short form agency with Sam par and Cody
1:35
Sanchez we've got keyframe our Animation
1:37
Studio with Dan Co and then we have a
1:40
few other businesses that were kind of
1:41
currently building in stealth that have
1:43
some customers that will launch publicly
1:45
pretty soon and can you break down a
1:46
little bit how these businesses are
1:48
doing what's been the most successful
1:49
one and then how does it look in terms
1:51
of Revenue and customers so we started
1:52
launching companies four months ago kind
1:54
of crazy to say that all of our
1:55
companies are doing over a million a
1:57
year in ARR three out of the four that
1:58
are public are doing multi to pull seven
2:00
figures a year right now out of the
2:02
current portfolio hey friends and off
2:04
menu are by far and away going to be the
2:06
biggest winners but off menu is probably
2:08
most exciting to talk about right now
2:09
because it's the one that we're getting
2:10
ready to announce next week I'm going to
2:13
call my shot I think off menu is going
2:14
to crack a 5 million run rate by
2:17
the end of October
2:19
fast
2:20
yeah how does it work fundamentally
2:22
fundamentally at the end of the day a
2:24
customer pays us for a predefined
2:27
service so in the case of hay friends
2:28
for example we have the Creator package
2:30
that starts at ten thousand dollars a
2:31
month and basically what that is is
2:33
everything you need to release six
2:37
really high quality YouTube videos per
2:39
month one of the biggest things for us
2:40
there is setting clear expectations with
2:43
our customers about how much volume you
2:45
can expect from us we're really not big
2:48
fans of the idea of like unlimited so we
2:50
really want to make sure that our
2:51
customers understand exactly what
2:53
they're getting for when they pay us
2:54
money yeah you built these amazing
2:56
businesses in the short few months
2:58
what's your backstory how do you get
3:00
here I mean I've been building
3:00
businesses for the better part of 15
3:03
years which makes me feel super old at
3:05
this point and I started my first agency
3:06
when I was 19. there I met one of my
3:10
closest friends to this day his name is
3:11
Austin Cameron I hired him as my lead
3:13
engineer at the time and together we
3:14
started working on this idea for a
3:15
startup we built that business to 3.2
3:18
million active users on 4 we can never
3:21
really monetize so we ended up selling
3:23
all the assets of that and then I got an
3:25
offer I could refuse from a big agency
3:27
here in town that basically said look
3:29
we'll give you a three million dollar a
3:30
year budget to build your own team and
3:31
basically build digital for our agency
3:34
it was fun at first we recruited an
3:35
amazing team but then there were all
3:37
these constraints that started stacking
3:39
up even ways that we could like
3:40
collaborate with our clients that were
3:42
really really cool Brands so that's
3:43
where we got the idea originally of just
3:45
saying like screw this let's just start
3:46
our own agency that's where Everest was
3:48
born and I built that business into the
3:50
eight figures of Revenue we worked with
3:52
Nike or Samsung or Obama right our
3:56
accounts got bigger and bigger but the
3:58
budgets were still kind of constrained
3:59
and my life just became one phone call
4:01
after another from VPS and EVPs just
4:04
bitching about problems that didn't
4:06
matter and I really quickly grew to just
4:08
hate running that business ultimately
4:10
just decided like it's time to take a
4:11
break and burned out so I took a six
4:13
month sabbatical and basically just like
4:15
around all day for six months did
4:17
zero work just kind of reading and
4:19
relaxing and really storing up enough
4:21
energy to go and build assembly along
4:23
the way of building Everest Sawhill
4:26
Bloom and I became pretty fast friends
4:27
and kept trying to find ways to like
4:30
work on something together and near the
4:32
end of my break we had a call scheduled
4:34
and you know both of us hopped on the
4:36
phone and he's like dude I got this idea
4:38
that I want to talk to you about and I
4:39
was like me too we basically discussed
4:40
the concept of partnering with creators
4:43
to build B2B businesses I said look
4:45
Let's Build 12 of them in 12 months
4:48
because that'll give us a the most
4:49
Diversified source of Revenue we could
4:51
possibly imagine B it'll allow us to
4:53
generate so much cash that we can go and
4:55
take a lot of really big bets that's
4:57
what we started doing so I flew out to
4:59
New York we had dinner kind of aligned
5:00
on what we were doing and I said look
5:01
let's just let's build a productized
5:03
agency first and keyframe was born three
5:05
weeks later I spent seven years trying
5:07
to build 24 different businesses but
5:09
only one of them was successful now that
5:12
business makes over a million dollars a
5:13
year but I could have done it a lot
5:15
faster if I studied already successful
5:17
businesses imagine you could read the
5:19
exact steps to how some one built a
5:21
million dollar business and the mistakes
5:23
they made so you can avoid them when you
5:25
launch well at starter store we have a
5:26
library of over 4 000 case studies and
5:28
business idea breakdowns where you can
5:30
do this all backed by real data for
5:32
example Loop joint starter story and
5:34
dove into our case studies about a
5:35
newsletter that makes 25 million dollars
5:37
a year just one month later he launched
5:40
his own newsletter and did fifty eight
5:41
hundred dollars in Revenue in 30 days
5:43
it's simple he studied what works
5:45
implemented it and avoided the mistakes
5:47
of people that were just a few steps
5:49
ahead of him so if you're serious about
5:50
finding a business idea that works and
5:52
making your first dollar 10 times faster
5:54
check out the first link in the
5:56
description we're running a special
5:57
right now for anyone coming from the
5:59
channel anyways enjoy the rest of the
6:00
video peace how do you usually come up
Productized Services
6:03
with ideas for a new productized service
6:05
to launch and how do you validate them
6:06
when we're looking at building a
6:08
productized service we're looking for a
6:11
really crowded Market if we can come
6:13
into the market with a really great
6:15
brand already populated with a ton of
6:16
success stories and case studies make
6:18
sure that it's a really concierge
6:20
experience that feel feels high end in
6:21
premium and then have a really trusted
6:23
creator that serves as this massive
6:25
boost of distribution at the beginning
6:27
of the business we can probably win in
6:30
that space really quickly the success of
6:32
the relationship really comes down to
6:34
something that we call product audience
6:35
fit so if you take all the Abdel for
6:37
example it made total sense for Ollie to
6:40
have a YouTube agency because he'd
6:42
taught thousands of people How To
6:44
Succeed on YouTube so what we do is we
6:45
come in with our Playbook with our team
6:47
our expertise our recruiting engine and
6:49
we build the entire Business proctise
6:51
Services they've kind of blown up over
6:53
the last couple years what do you think
6:54
the opportunity is here I think the
6:56
opportunity is huge it's an interface to
6:58
where a customer says hey this is the
7:00
problem I'm trying to solve or the goal
7:02
that I have and instantly sees work so I
7:05
think that that way of working and just
7:07
making it the super clear transactional
7:10
relationship I pay you X dollars you
7:12
give me a y result is beautiful we
7:14
wanted to comment and approach it from
7:16
the perspective of like let's build a
7:18
really great operationally sound
7:20
business you know our contribution
7:22
margins and like our cash flow cycles
7:24
and how we're servicing customers to
7:26
make sure that they're really well taken
7:28
care of when you can do all of that and
7:30
wrap it in this simple like pretty ten
7:34
thousand dollar a month price point it
7:35
becomes really easy to sell especially
7:37
when we have the distribution that we do
7:39
but there's downsides of course I think
7:41
every subscription or productized
7:43
service wants to view their business
7:45
from the standpoint of mrr but at the
7:47
end of the day there's a finite nature
7:49
to a lot of these projects you know off
7:51
menu has like decently High chart but
7:54
what's crazy is that doesn't matter
7:56
because our average you know customer
7:57
values 60 to 75 000 while they're with
8:00
us and the margins are fantastic what
8:02
you've done so brilliantly is you find
8:05
influencers or creators in the space and
8:07
build businesses with them can you tell
8:09
me a little bit more about that and how
8:11
other people watching could do something
8:12
similar first I have to acknowledge that
8:14
we kind of have an unfair Advantage
8:15
we're really fortunate that we have
8:16
great Network you know there's no big
8:18
sales pitch for us to go to a Creator
8:19
and try and convince and some to work
8:21
with us we already have these
8:22
relationships really what we're doing at
8:24
the end of the day is just talking to
8:26
our friends and seeing if it makes sense
8:28
for us to build a business together but
8:29
I think what's most interesting is like
8:31
how did I get there I slowly over years
8:34
just built my network by never asking
8:36
for anything just always giving along
8:38
the way you build a lot of trust and
8:41
people know you as a person that is just
8:42
really high integrity really loyal I
8:45
think that's a really special thing that
8:46
a lot of people miss when they look for
8:48
that like quick buck and how does it
8:49
work in terms of the partnership is
8:51
there an equity split with the
8:53
influencer or profit sharing or right
8:56
the typical model for this they're not
8:58
like affiliate Partners they're actual
9:00
Partners in these businesses they're
9:02
really instrumental in helping get them
9:03
off the ground they're instrumental in
9:06
the insights that drive the business and
9:08
the service it provides and that works
9:09
really well for us building businesses
Scale
9:11
like these require seemingly a lot of
9:14
scale and you've gone from three people
9:16
to over 50 in four months tell me about
9:19
how you've been able to scale so I have
9:21
this method that basically
9:24
I say like let's move super fast break
9:26
everything and just create this
9:28
wake of chaos and then stop and just
9:31
clean it all up and so we just went
9:33
through our clean it all up phase I do
9:34
want to be honest and say like for us to
9:36
hit that scale so quickly we really had
9:37
to cut a lot of Corners
9:39
um which has its pros and its cons but
9:41
fortunately I think we did a good job of
9:43
recruiting people that were okay with
9:46
that that could like thrive in that
9:48
sense of ambiguity what's your approach
9:49
to finding great people and hiring them
9:51
it's different for every company that we
9:53
run you know for off menu for example
9:55
we're only looking for like principal or
9:58
creative level designers in above so
10:01
there it's all Network driven very
10:02
carefully curated but if you look at a
10:04
company like viral Cuts you're like hey
10:06
friends to where we need to hire 50
10:08
video editors as fast as we can a lot of
10:11
what we rely on is careful recruiting
10:13
for the first handful and then we offer
10:15
really great referral incentives if you
10:18
know another editor or you're friends
10:19
with somebody that's looking for a new
10:21
role have them come here at the end of
10:22
the day like one of our secrets
10:23
recruiting is just being like a really
10:26
great generous employer and that's
10:28
worked wonders for us you're able to
10:29
launch all these businesses most people
10:31
including me have trouble just figuring
10:33
out how to launch one business why is it
10:35
different for you what's your approach
10:37
it's a tremendous amount of really hard
10:39
work I'm only able to do it because I've
10:42
got a fantastic team that I'm working
10:43
with some of the core team members that
10:45
we have are guys that I've worked with
10:47
for years and it's easy for us to just
10:49
get into Rhythm and go so it's been one
10:51
of the biggest drivers but at the end of
10:52
the day it's still you know I work 10 to
10:55
14 hours a day six days a week yeah tell
10:58
me about these 10 to 14 hour days what
11:00
is a typical day in the life look like
11:02
you what do you spend most of your time
11:04
doing I have this framework that I call
11:06
damn decisions that I have to make
11:09
actions I have to take and messages I
11:11
have to send I structure my week that
11:12
way so Monday is all about decisions
11:14
Tuesday is all about actions and
11:16
Wednesday is all about messages I wake
11:18
up on Mondays with a ton of data from
11:21
our team and then I use that time to
11:23
make a lot of decisions Visions on what
11:24
we need to do to essentially optimize
11:27
the businesses that we're running or the
11:29
businesses that we're currently
11:30
incubating Tuesdays you know the action
11:32
part of my week I really spend thinking
11:34
through what actions do I have to take
11:36
today to move the rest of these
11:38
businesses forward for the week based on
11:41
the decisions that I made yesterday
11:42
Wednesday's messages I communicate all
11:44
that to the team that's really the core
11:45
driver of my work Thursdays I leave for
11:47
calls talking with other CEOs sometimes
11:50
helping out with sales calls things like
11:51
that and then Fridays I typically write
11:53
I try and do more deep work seems like
11:55
you are making a big bet on productized
11:57
Services can you tell me more about that
11:58
I want to be clear it's just the launch
12:00
pad we just View productized Services as
12:03
the first phase of what we're building
12:05
when you think about productized
12:07
Services you have this fantastic free
12:09
cash flow engine from there the question
12:11
is what do you do with all that free
12:12
cash flow and that's where we're
12:13
thinking much bigger right we're looking
12:15
at products we're looking at SAS we're
12:17
looking at really interesting ways for
12:20
us to scale what we're building at
12:22
assembly in phase two Beyond this notion
12:25
of a human being is required to turn a
12:27
profit but it sounds like the
12:29
productized service as you said is a
12:31
great way to start generating cash even
12:33
for someone watching this video it's
12:34
kind of a great first business to start
12:36
100 if you think that you have a skill
12:39
set and you're better at that skill than
12:41
let's say 80 of the market yeah you
12:43
could probably build a successful
12:45
productized service around that but I
12:47
think the thing you have to do is
12:48
recognize three things one really think
12:51
critically about the model of the
12:52
business that you're building right make
12:54
sure that you have a value prop for your
12:56
customer that's super clear make sure
12:58
you're building it in a way that's
12:59
healthy and that you can scale the
13:01
second thing I think is super important
13:02
is make sure that in everything you do
13:06
you're constantly over delivering that
13:08
value to customers because that's how
13:10
you'll build your business long term
13:11
because you need referrals then three I
13:13
think the thing you have to keep in mind
13:15
is how are you actually building a
13:18
business and not just freelancing in
13:20
Disguise as solopreneurship so last
13:23
question and that we ask to all founders
13:26
is if you go back 10 years and sit on
13:28
Hunter's shoulder what advice would you
13:30
give him the number one piece of advice
13:32
I would give myself is to create content
13:35
share publicly what I'm doing that's my
13:37
biggest regret my career 100 is that I
13:40
didn't spend the last decade building an
13:42
audience the second I would say like I
13:45
probably want to think more clearly
13:46
about my long-term goals 10 years ago
13:48
all I did was like make money and spend
13:51
money if I wanted to do it I did it
13:52
which was great because I collected a
13:54
ton of like amazing experiences but I
13:57
really wish I'd taken a different
13:58
approach and I built a more scalable
14:00
business and really the other thing I
14:02
would do I would have spent a lot more
14:04
time nurturing long-term relationships
14:07
that's something that has always been
14:08
one of my weaknesses I get kind of
14:10
introverted I get like lost in like
14:11
whatever it is I'm doing and I'm
14:13
horrible at like following up with
14:15
friends and staying on top of that as
14:17
I've gotten older I've learned from some
14:19
friends that are just absolute Masters
14:21
at that art form it's not easy like to
14:24
pick up that phone and be like how you
14:25
been dude like and keep that
14:27
conversation going it's it's tough you
14:29
just want to go into your yeah pull and
14:31
go heads down I think you can do it
14:32
yourself yeah all right man thank you so
14:34
much thanks for coming man yeah it was
14:36
great with all this advice and you will
14:40
be launching 12 companies in 12 months
14:43
hahaha

Title: He Built A $600,000 One Person Business (with video editing)
Show: Starter Story
Host: Pat Walls
Aired: Mar 27, 2023
Here's how Scott went from freelance video editor to running a $50,000/month company in 1 year.
Transcript:
Intro
0:00
I never made more than like 40 50k a
0:02
year out of college and that's pre-tax
0:04
so I was broke so I packed up my car
0:07
drove like 1200 miles away that's where
0:10
I kind of learned how to like talk to
0:11
people Network do customer service write
0:14
blogs all right so today we're meeting
0:16
up with Scott he makes 50 000 a month
0:18
making videos and he's going to show us
0:20
exactly how he does it
0:23
[Music]
0:26
so yeah tell me tell me about what you
The business
0:28
do what do you want yeah so we run uh
0:31
basically it's a productized service for
0:33
B2B SAS companies so think about like an
0:36
agency service except you're able to buy
0:39
it kind of like an e-commerce product so
0:41
it's it's short animated videos for B2B
0:44
SAS companies to run as paid ads and and
0:46
get customers in the door what's a
Type of clients he sells to
0:48
typical client for who we work with we
0:50
work with software companies that are
0:52
primarily B2B so they have platforms
0:54
like you think of stripe like a payment
0:56
processor or something like that and
0:58
they're typically also funded so an
1:00
important part about selling something
1:02
like a productized service is making
1:04
sure that the people have the money to
1:06
actually buy what you're selling so we
1:07
found that companies that are VC backed
1:10
or have gone through like
1:12
um seed and series a funding they
1:14
typically have the money to to purchase
1:16
what we're selling so that's what works
What makes a valuable product
1:18
best for us and companies want this
1:19
because it helps sell more of their
1:21
product or helps their brand Market
1:23
better the main goal with the videos is
1:25
not necessarily
1:26
to directly get our clients more
1:30
customers it's more so to get the
1:32
potential customers to like stop
1:34
scrolling or to maybe go book a demo or
1:37
something like that right it's more of
1:39
like the scroll stopper some people call
1:41
it where it's super attention grabbing
1:46
but it doesn't give you enough
1:48
information to actually like go buy the
Scott's early days
1:50
service or product tell me a little bit
1:51
more about your background you were
1:52
doing actual video agency work yeah so
1:55
I've done I've done everything I've done
1:56
like music videos event Recaps you know
1:59
me and a friend used to shoot weddings
2:00
and just like basically everything I've
2:03
also been a designer built websites all
2:06
this stuff and for me videos what really
2:08
stuck and then it was hard for me to
2:11
scale and it was it was hard to get work
2:13
I didn't really know what I was doing so
2:16
I ended up stumbling onto Twitter and
2:19
meeting you know a lot of the people
2:20
what they call Like Money Twitter right
2:22
and that's really all about how can you
2:25
take what you already know how to do
2:27
which for me was the video production
2:28
stuff and monetize it at a higher level
2:31
and then that's when I kind of got into
2:33
all the technical technical business
2:35
stuff you go to college or anything like
Dropping out of college
2:37
that uh I went for two months and
2:40
dropped out I think why did you drop
2:41
that what happened yeah so I ended up
2:43
meeting this guy and he's like hey I'm
2:45
I'm starting this business in Colorado
2:48
you know we're going to try to like help
2:50
people manage vacation rental properties
2:52
like I think you'd be a good fit for it
2:55
so I packed up my car drove like 1200
2:58
miles away I hadn't had any actual
3:01
business experience prior to that but
3:04
that's where I kind of learned how to
3:05
like talk to people Network do customer
3:07
service write blogs stuff like that that
3:10
was in 2019 I think so I was 19. yeah
3:14
when I did that so now you're only like
3:15
what 24 23 yeah I didn't really make any
Building a resume
3:19
money until the last like year even
3:22
though I tried all this stuff after
3:23
college I mean it was all just learning
3:25
you know I never made more than like 40
3:27
50k a year out of college so I mean and
3:30
that's pre-tax so I was broke yeah you
3:33
know the three and a half years after I
3:35
left but I was able to leverage my
3:37
skills and this is something for like a
3:39
lot of people too that they can they can
3:41
use is like if you have a specific skill
3:44
if you can find ways not just to make
3:46
money with it but like for me for
3:48
example because of the video stuff I've
3:50
gotten to like go shoot at NASCAR in the
3:52
pit and just a bunch of cool stuff even
3:54
though I wasn't getting paid very well
3:56
for that it was stuff that I was able to
3:58
add to my resume of just things that
4:01
you're able to do has video always been
How he started video editing
4:03
your passion I've been doing videos
4:04
since 2016 and it it started off
4:07
actually as I opened up Adobe
4:10
Illustrator Junior High School to make
4:12
like these presentations for some
4:14
business class I was in and then that
4:16
evolved into me getting a camera and
4:19
trying out photography and then
4:21
photography got boring so I tried out
4:23
video
4:25
um and then now it's kind of an
4:26
intersection of of all of them with what
4:28
I'm doing because it's like design but
4:30
it's moving and all that stuff but
4:33
really personally like I enjoy anything
4:35
creative so I've I've painted I've you
4:38
know I used to like play some
4:40
instruments just really any anything
Going from $50K/year to $50K/month
4:42
like that so your business took off and
4:45
you said you're making fifty thousand
4:46
dollars a month now is that right yeah
4:48
on average it bounces around a little
4:50
bit with any business right like it
4:51
could be like 35 then it could be like
4:53
55 right yeah just depends on your lead
4:55
Insurance you know before that you were
4:58
making maybe 50 000 a year and you grew
5:00
to pretty much 10x that was there any
5:02
mindset shift or was there anything that
5:04
really set this business apart from
5:06
others if if I was going to choose one
5:08
thing it would be switching from a
5:12
scarcity mindset to an abundance mindset
5:15
and it sounds really I guess like cheesy
5:17
or like or whatever if you make the
5:20
shift to taking those same resources
5:22
again whether it's money the knowledge
5:24
Network you have right in just full-on
5:27
like utilizing them to try to produce
5:30
more of what you have and grow that I
5:33
think the whole game changes before this
How to turn your passion into a business
5:36
business you had kind of a lot of
5:37
creative type jobs you were doing video
5:38
how could someone who is is also
5:41
creative an artist a videographer anyone
5:44
in doing production how can they turn
5:45
that into a business and be able to work
5:47
for themselves speaking from what worked
5:49
for me I think that the biggest thing
5:51
one get on social media right and I'll
5:54
use Twitter as an example because that's
5:55
again what worked for me so what I would
5:58
do is be posting every day sit down for
6:02
an hour schedule it out be consistent
6:04
and write things or make reels or
6:08
whatever you're going to do about things
6:10
specific to what you're doing are so if
6:14
it's video make educational content for
6:17
Brands about how they can get more
6:20
customers in the door with video right
6:21
that's kind of what I did and then once
6:24
you have that down once you're
6:25
consistently posting you get a feel for
6:27
it and you're learning about
6:29
the specific platform that you're
6:31
posting to then that's when you can
6:33
start actually selling a service what
Business Ideas
6:37
works best for that is the productized
6:39
model we talked about so again if you're
6:41
doing something like video right there's
6:43
a ton of different things you could do
6:44
you could design thumbnails for YouTube
6:46
you could do an on-demand video editing
6:48
service you could do a color grading
6:50
service right and come up with like a
6:52
specific offer and packages to sell or
6:55
some kind of offer structure where let's
6:58
say your main package is three thousand
7:00
dollars a month then you can have a down
7:02
sell or an upsell or whatever right and
7:04
so what that might look like is certain
7:06
deliverables inside of a package and a
7:09
deliverable would be like we'll color
7:11
grade this many videos in this specific
7:13
way for this amount of money if you can
7:15
have a service that people need is
7:18
recurring and you can find the people
7:21
who have the money to buy it then
7:23
there's there's really no stopping you
The best business model
7:25
yeah and you think that's more effective
7:26
than just I guess selling your time to
7:30
do some some video work for you know a
7:32
few hours 100 packaging your your skill
7:35
set is much more effective because
7:37
you're in control of what you're
7:39
charging you're being paid for your
7:40
expertise not your actual time so if you
7:44
had an a person and a b person and they
7:46
both had 10 years of experience maybe
7:48
you say a person is getting paid hourly
7:50
even if it's 500 an hour right like
7:52
they're a lawyer or something and then B
7:54
person is selling a a productized
7:56
service they're still going to make 10
7:58
times more because they could sell what
8:00
person a is doing for 500 an hour maybe
8:03
it takes them 10 hours and then person B
8:06
can then charge five thousand dollars
8:09
give them the same result and so
8:11
technically person a and person B are
8:14
being compensated the same the person B
8:16
can go and then hire people to help them
8:18
fulfill that right and so it's just this
8:21
whole this whole scaling thing is is
8:23
where you make the real money do you
Building a team
8:25
have any employees or is it just you
8:27
yeah so I started off by myself and now
8:30
we have a team of about four so I don't
8:33
have any full-time employees but I have
8:35
like a couple full-time contractors and
8:37
then some like a closer in fractional
8:40
roles that help me do certain things
8:42
operationally yeah and my team is is
8:44
also International as well how's that
Hiring overseas
8:46
work it's great because I mean for a lot
8:48
of reasons but they get paid you know
8:51
more than they would make where they are
8:53
and my team's pretty young too like
8:55
younger than me so it's cool to be able
8:57
to give people you know like when I back
9:00
when I was 18 like I would have loved to
9:02
be doing what they're doing now yeah and
9:04
so it's it's cool to bring that full
9:05
circle and be able to pay someone what
9:07
they're worth more than they would make
9:09
where they live you know they can work
9:11
remote they're not my employees so they
9:13
take trips and stuff and take work off
9:15
so that's that's been enjoyable too and
How to find good talent
9:17
how do you find really good talent
9:19
there's a lot of ways but when you start
9:21
building an audience people will
9:22
naturally want to work for you because
9:24
they believe in what you're doing and
9:26
they think that what you're doing is
9:27
cool so all the people that are working
9:29
for me right now reached out to me and
9:31
the reason I hired them is because I
9:33
know if they're reaching out to me that
9:34
they're really dedicated and motivated
9:37
to get done what they want to do and
9:39
it's turned out to be true so far so how
Costs + Techstack
9:41
much does it cost to run your business
9:43
like generally speaking monthly
9:46
so we have a tech stack that is and then
9:50
there's also Payment Processing fees and
9:52
stuff like that
9:53
um in terms of like labor it's hard to
9:56
put a put a put a pin on that because
9:59
it's completely dependent on how many
10:02
videos we're doing are gross profit
10:04
margins
10:05
um are about 65 and then net is probably
10:10
between 40 and 50 just depending on a
10:13
couple things but in terms of our the
10:15
tech stack is really the only one thing
10:17
that we consistently spend money on yeah
10:19
on a monthly basis what do you mean by
10:21
Tech stack so okay so we have the cold
10:24
email sending software the software that
10:27
we run the list through I have to pay
10:28
for slack you know we use stripe which
10:30
is free but we paid the fee on that Tech
10:33
stack specifically is probably like
10:35
twelve hundred dollars a month and
10:37
that's so that's just what we use to be
10:39
able to actually execute the services
10:40
that we sell right
10:46
I notice you mentioned building an
How to build an audience
10:48
audience what does that look like for
10:49
you just posting consistently
10:52
um and finding a niche too when you
10:54
think of a niche like it has to be
10:56
really specific like super specific so
10:59
at first it was just videos for me and
11:02
then it became short videos like no
11:04
longer than 60 seconds right and then it
11:07
became short videos for online Brands
11:10
and then it went to short videos for
11:13
online brands that are B2B SAS companies
Advantages of a niche
11:17
did you see the business grow when you
11:19
kept niching down like that yes because
11:21
it made it very obvious like who our
11:23
product was for it's counterintuitive
11:26
too because like when you the more
11:28
people you say like no you're not a fit
11:30
then the faster you'll find people that
11:31
will actually buy from you have you been
11:34
able to raise your prices because of
11:35
this niching down that you've done yeah
11:37
we've we the first video we sold was
11:40
five hundred dollars and we've basically
11:44
Timex our prices so now our average
11:46
order value is like 3K but we sell we
11:51
just introduced some new packages that
11:53
have been selling really well from
11:54
anywhere from six to twelve what advice
Advice for beginners
11:56
would you have just for anyone that
11:59
wants to get started with an online
12:00
business what's the first step do things
12:02
like go on YouTube and do research on
12:05
what you actually want to do and then I
12:07
would spend as much money as you can
12:08
afford on coaching and programs that are
12:13
fit on what direction you wanna you
12:16
wanna go from people that are reputable
12:17
not not lamb burgers
Work setup
12:26
this is where I get a lot of my work
12:28
done we got the the nice aperture light
12:31
set up here and trust the old 16-inch
12:34
MacBook Pro so we actually
12:36
coincidentally just closed the deal
12:37
right as we started filming this so nope
12:40
it's got a 400 sale we've got starter
12:42
stories a good luck charm so we're gonna
12:44
send this contract out and then talk a
12:46
little bit about how we got here in the
Growing the biz to $50K/month
12:48
first place you said you'd grown it from
12:50
zero to fifty thousand pretty much in a
12:52
year what did that look like did you
12:53
start with just like 5 000 a month how
12:55
did that grow we kind of started how we
12:58
are still now but we sophisticated our
13:01
offer so before it was you'll buy one
13:04
video it'll basically be whatever length
13:06
and it's a flat fee essentially what we
13:08
did now is we created a package so
13:11
you're not only buying you can still buy
13:13
one video but we use this as a down sell
13:15
now if someone doesn't want to buy the
13:17
package with the packages it's a set of
13:20
videos and then we reformat that set of
13:23
videos so that people can run it on all
13:26
the platforms and things like that and
13:28
then we also will set up retargeting ads
13:31
for them we won't run them but we'll do
13:33
a bunch of setup and stuff like that so
13:35
that it's an offer that's more inclusive
13:38
of what the end goal is rather than just
13:40
here as a video it actually sets them up
13:42
for Success yeah so when you started
Pivoting + Revenue in early days
13:45
repackaging your offering like that is
13:46
that when you started to see the growth
13:47
in terms of I guess like financially
13:49
yeah because in terms of monthly like
13:51
Revenue it was like 7K then 5K then 9k
13:55
and then we went to like 12 23 33 and I
14:01
would say what we introduced that offer
14:04
when we were struggling to get above
14:05
like 12km Yeah because it just wasn't
14:07
the one videos were sophisticated enough
14:10
and the ticket price wasn't high enough
14:12
to bring us past that right how did you
Finding clients
14:14
find your first customer what's been
14:16
your main channel for growth yeah so
14:17
there's been a couple different ones
14:19
some work better than others but
14:21
primarily we've done Twitter we've done
14:23
cold email we've done like direct dming
14:26
so like on sales navigator on LinkedIn
14:28
or through Twitter and really I mean
14:31
keeping it simple like it's just really
14:33
cold Outreach and then the organic
14:35
content reaching out to people for the
Cold outreach + Cold email example
14:37
viewers who don't know a lot about cold
14:39
Outreach what does that typically look
14:40
like like how many uh cold emails are
14:43
you sending and what what's like your
14:45
lead response rate that sort of stuff
14:46
you got to send a lot and for our ICP
14:50
which is stands for ideal customer
14:52
profile specifically the open rate or
14:54
reply rate for software is only about
14:56
they're two different things the reply
14:58
rate is really only like four four
15:00
percent typically on average so you know
15:03
you're talking about reaching out to
15:04
thousands of people and then when you
15:08
get those people to reply now all of
15:10
them will book a call with you either
15:11
right um so it's kind of you just have
15:13
to do the math depending on what your
15:15
numbers look like
15:17
um and in terms of you know what a cold
15:19
email looks like it's basically it's
15:21
really simple it's
15:22
basically two sentences it's like hey
15:24
you know we noticed on your site that
15:27
you don't have a video like above the
15:30
fold on your landing page that's
15:31
something we do like have you ever
15:33
looked into that and that's it you know
15:35
a lot of people will write like a huge
15:37
paragraph and like no one has a title
15:39
right so how does the sales process work
Sales funnel (secret sauce)
15:41
for anyone that's running kind of a
15:42
productized service what would you
15:43
recommend doing or yeah so to break it
15:45
down really simply you'll basically have
15:47
like top of funnel you have like the
15:49
middle of the funnel and then you have
15:50
bottle funnel so top of funnel for us is
15:53
organic social posting the DMS in cold
15:56
email and then the ads right so like
15:58
those three things what happens is a
16:00
certain amount of people convert from
16:03
top of funnel to the middle of the
16:04
funnel so someone will open the email
16:06
someone will see a post of ours or even
16:08
both sometimes people will open an email
16:10
and then go check out my LinkedIn
16:12
profile right and then they'll book a
16:13
call either directly to our socials or
16:16
on the website and that's kind of the
16:17
middle funnel and the bottom of the
16:19
funnel is like getting on a sales call
16:21
with my closer then either buy or not
16:24
buy essentially yeah so it's yeah it's
16:26
basically those three main parts where
How to learn about business
16:28
did you learn this B2B and
16:29
um so the coaching and then just trying
16:32
it out yourself yeah so the coaching is
16:34
good for like at least for me like I
16:36
felt like pretty directionless I was
16:37
like oh you know I know I want to have
16:39
an online business but I don't know
16:42
where to start I don't know like what
16:44
kind of stuff to watch but you're
16:45
dedicated and you know you want to do it
16:47
so I spent the money in the coaching the
16:50
coaching gave me an hour line and
16:52
Direction and then I took that direction
16:54
and I tried it myself so for example the
16:57
cold email stuff I knew enough to
16:59
actually just try it I didn't know
17:01
enough to do it and then you start doing
17:03
it more and through repetition you get
17:06
you get better at it yeah so same thing
17:08
with the sales calls like
17:10
I'm not a salesperson like I don't like
17:13
doing it and but I've probably taken
17:15
like 150 sales calls and then once I
17:19
took enough sales calls to have a
17:21
structure to it I gave that to someone
17:23
to do for them what's your schedule
Daily routine
17:25
what's a typical day for you like wake
17:26
up at 7 30 start working by like eight
17:30
or eight thirty drink a ton of coffee
17:31
and in terms of actually working I
17:34
probably sit at my desk you know eight
17:36
hours a day pretty normal working amount
17:39
and then you know an hour or two is also
17:42
just spent like thinking like walking
17:43
and stuff like that when I'm actually
17:45
sitting at my desk what I'm doing is
17:47
project management so I'm in slack
17:49
channels you know communicating with
17:51
clients implementing feedback delivering
17:54
products to them things like that a
17:57
certain top portion of my time is spent
17:59
doing organic content so writing I'm
18:02
going to be recording more videos
18:04
um planning stuff out for that and then
18:08
um also consuming a certain amount of
18:10
content you know obviously try not to
18:11
consume too much yeah but maybe threads
18:14
about building your business and stuff
18:16
like that so like a certain amount is
18:17
fulfillment some of it is sales and
18:21
overseeing some of the people that work
18:22
with me and then just trying to get
18:25
better every day yeah do you work on the
Working on weekends
18:27
weekends
18:28
yeah
18:29
um so the thing about weekends for me
18:31
personally is if I if I don't I don't
18:34
work like eight hours on Sunday and
18:36
eight hours on Saturday but
18:39
I find that if I don't work at all on
18:42
the weekends I lose some sort of like
18:45
momentum or I feel like I'm coming back
18:48
into my business and I've been gone for
Vacations as an entrepreneur
18:50
a week exactly so on that same note
18:52
vacation you take time off or do you
18:54
take time to recharge or anything like
18:56
that yeah so I actually recently took
18:58
off that's the other cool thing about
19:00
having a business though is like
19:03
you don't have like PTO necessarily you
19:06
can kind of do it when you want as long
19:08
as you have some sort of system in place
19:11
um but yeah I recently I recently went
19:13
out to California for like a week and
19:15
then another cool thing is because it's
19:17
fully remote like I could go on like a
19:20
working trip and still work but have a
19:23
refreshed you know environment to work
19:25
in yeah
Advice on passion
19:28
foreign
19:30
if there's one last thing something I
19:33
hear really often is like you know
19:34
follow your passion
19:36
it's kind of like
19:39
follow instead of following your passion
19:42
like save your passion for what you want
19:44
to do outside of work
19:46
what you should really be doing at least
19:48
in my experience is following what
19:50
you're good at and you like doing
19:51
because if you find something you're
19:54
good at and you enjoy doing you're ahead
19:57
of 99 of people already yeah
19:59
and then you can just save your passion
20:01
for
20:02
because you don't want to make your
20:03
passion yeah yeah so and if you're good
20:06
at something it's a lot easier to just
20:08
kind of do it every day even when you're
20:10
not making any money it's like if you're
20:12
good at something it feels good to do it
20:14
therefore and yeah and so for me that
20:16
was video I used to do them for free you
20:18
know like way back when I was like 16 I
20:21
used to do them for free and my mom was
20:22
like you need to start charging money
20:24
for these I was like oh really like and
20:27
now we're here so yeah yeah

Title: Zero to $1.1B from Flipping Websites
Show: Starter Story
Host: Pat Walls
Aired: Apr 17, 2023
In this episode I talked to Thomas Smale in his New York City Office to get his story and some advice on how to buy and sell businesses. He's done over $1B dollars in sales without even knowing how to develop a website, and he shares his advice on how to flip businesses, how to negotiate, and how he would start again if he had $0 dollars. This is a perfect episode for anyone who is hesitant on starting a business, and would rather buy one and build it from there. 
Transcript:
Intro
0:00
have helped people sell over a billion
0:01
dollars of businesses meet Thomas he
0:04
went from flipping websites in his dorm
0:06
room for a hundred bucks to selling over
0:08
one billion dollars in online businesses
0:10
and it took a very very long time to get
0:12
to that stage he invited me up to his
0:13
office in New York City to tell his
0:15
story and show me how anyone can become
0:17
rich by buying and selling businesses my
0:20
first deal was selling like a hundred
0:22
dollars into 500 and now we regularly
0:25
close eight figure transactions you are
0:27
not going to make your living long-term
0:28
buying things for a hundred dollars and
0:30
selling them to 200 you will do if you
0:33
can apply that same skill to buy for a
0:35
million and sell for two million because
0:36
all you're really trying to do is learn
0:37
the process he shares a master class on
0:40
how to flip businesses for profit how to
0:42
negotiate deals and how you can buy your
0:44
first business with zero dollars welcome
0:46
to starter story
Getting into M&A
0:49
all right so let's go back to the early
0:50
days I know you got a big team now
0:52
you're in this big fancy uh Manhattan
0:54
high-rise but how did you get into this
0:56
industry yeah so when I was at College
0:58
like many college kids I was trying to
1:00
find ways to make extra money I
1:02
discovered very early on the idea of
1:04
buying and selling domain names and this
1:06
is back in 2008 2009 bought my first
1:09
domain name sold it for slightly more
1:11
money I never really understood the idea
1:13
of domains because it didn't really get
1:15
how they had any value so I then
1:17
discovered you could buy established
1:19
websites which were businesses because
1:20
they made money and you could buy them
1:22
and sell them for more I think the first
1:23
deal I ever did was like bought a
1:24
website for a hundred dollars got that
1:26
to making a little bit of money every
1:27
month and then I sold it at the end of
1:29
the month more than I paid so I think my
1:31
first deal was something like a hundred
1:33
dollars into 500 and because they didn't
1:36
have any money that was on my credit
1:37
card so I was paying off my credit card
1:39
by physically selling and then moved up
1:43
from there so started with nothing she
1:45
started out buying selling myself after
1:47
I'd done that for a while interview 2010
1:49
when I technically founded every
1:51
International I was graduating college I
1:54
didn't want to get a job I wanted to
1:55
turn it into a full-time business but
1:57
because I didn't have any money it was
1:59
very difficult to make a full-time
2:00
living buying and selling so I wrote a
2:02
book about buying selling websites
2:04
domains so I thought back then it was
2:06
very popular I got really fortunate it
2:08
got off the ground started making enough
2:10
to pay rent I thought I would never have
2:12
to do anything other than just sell
2:14
courses or sell books essentially what
2:16
ended up happening is people that would
2:18
go through the course and they'd read
2:20
the book and they say Thomas I've
2:21
watched all the videos read the book
2:23
listened to everything I'm in the
2:24
membership area I have a business can
2:26
you sell it for me so I had no idea what
2:28
M A was either and I thought well I can
2:30
help you sell I didn't have to put up
2:31
any money myself it's a process I
2:33
already understand and I can get paid to
2:35
do that so that's how I accidentally
2:36
stumbled into M A there was no M A firms
2:39
that did this there were no business
2:40
brokers if you had a really big business
2:42
you couldn't call a big Investment Bank
2:44
because they wouldn't return your phone
2:45
call so very much offered a service that
2:47
no one else did
2:48
and really built it from from there okay
Self-taught website flipper
2:51
so in college you were just flipping
2:53
websites almost like for fun uh can you
2:56
tell me a little bit more about that
2:57
yeah I think at the time when you're at
2:58
college if you didn't have any money
3:00
like I didn't you had to make so many
3:02
some money somehow so the option was
3:05
either go work at a bar work at a
3:07
restaurant or find a way to make money
3:08
myself so I've dreaded my first deal and
3:11
even though it was only a tiny amount of
3:12
money I figured it's something you can
3:15
do basically any time of day as long as
3:16
you had a laptop and an internet
3:18
connection my challenge was always the
3:20
fact I just didn't have any money so the
3:21
challenge I always set myself was either
3:24
max out my credit card or put as much as
3:26
I could on my credit card at the
3:27
beginning of the month and then try to
3:29
sell it by the end of the month and if I
3:30
hadn't it'd be accruing interest so it
3:32
was kind of an incentive to get a deal
3:34
done business is like yours and like
3:36
helpful resources didn't exist 15 years
3:39
ago there's nowhere you could go to
3:40
learn about how to build a business so
3:42
there were some forums forums don't
3:45
really exist today people go in Facebook
3:47
groups they go on Twitter they go on
3:49
Tick Tock wherever they might be but
3:51
that's where people now discover
3:52
information and tips but back then there
3:55
was no Playbook you had to figure it out
3:57
that's what I did for a long time so I
3:59
was very much
4:00
self-taught I think if I were to start
4:03
the business today I probably would have
4:04
never started the same business because
4:06
there's so much information out there I
4:08
probably would have found something else
4:09
to start that would have found equally
4:11
interesting
4:12
[Music]
How he started an M&A firm
4:17
you finished up with college and you 've
4:19
sold a course and you made thirty
4:21
thousand dollars on that course then you
4:23
took that money and reinvested and
4:25
actually started the firm how did how
4:27
did that look at the time I think one of
4:29
the first things I learned very early on
4:31
is I didn't know how to do everything
4:33
and as you grow in your business you'll
4:35
realize that becomes even more the case
4:36
and you get to Stage as you scale where
4:39
you should just focus on the things you
4:40
are best at and if you're not the best
4:42
at it you should hire people to do that
4:44
believe it or not I was not in any way
4:45
technical so buying selling websites but
4:48
I had no idea and I still don't today
4:49
anything server related anything
4:51
technical I could make some basic edits
4:54
myself but that was really it so the
4:55
first thing I did was we opened a small
4:57
office and we hired two people they were
4:59
helping on the technical side I was
5:01
essentially doing all the selling and
5:03
that was the very early days of the
5:04
business my current business partner
5:06
Ismail joined he he had worked at Big
5:09
Investment Bank came into what we were
5:11
doing and applied everything he had
5:13
learned doing multi-billion dollar
5:15
transactions to the tiny the biggest
5:17
deal we've done back then was 30 000
5:19
dollars applying the same processes to
5:21
that so 2012 onwards that was really how
5:24
we got the business off the ground
5:25
because if it's always just you and you
5:27
never hire any people it's very
5:29
difficult to to scale and I knew from
5:31
the start I didn't want to be a
5:33
freelancer which is a perfectly good way
5:35
to make a living if that's what you
5:36
wanted to do I wanted to build a
5:38
business and the only way you do that is
5:39
by hiring people when you look back at
Using the Pareto Principle to make more money
5:41
that time what was what was your biggest
5:43
learnings from that I think firstly once
5:45
you have some scale so you're making
5:47
some money you have to look at things
5:50
very objectively look at the data and
5:53
make a decision what is most profitable
5:55
for you and your business so if someone
5:58
came in I remember we had this
5:59
conversation very early on he said
6:01
Thomas you're working on four different
6:03
parts of the business this part makes
6:06
all the money these parts do not make so
6:08
much but you're spending 80 of your time
6:11
on the things that don't make any money
6:13
so you could call it perito principle I
6:15
was spending 20 of my time on the thing
6:17
that made 80 of the money so we said and
6:19
we decided why continue doing the other
6:21
things let's stop doing them and focus
6:24
on the things that are working but yeah
6:25
very early on we were data driven and it
6:28
was really just what made us the most
6:29
money and like ultimately we were trying
6:31
to build a business you don't have a
6:33
business if you're not making money so
6:35
that's what we decided to do for our
How to buy a business
6:36
audience who wants to maybe find the
6:38
first business that they'll buy what
6:40
would be your advice on how to find good
6:42
businesses for cheap yeah so the first
6:44
thing you need to do is figure out what
6:47
you want to invest there's no point
6:48
looking for a business to acquire if you
6:50
don't know how much money you have or
6:52
what you're looking to achieve so start
6:54
with budget start by identifying a
6:56
business model you're comfortable with
6:57
so maybe you want to buy a Blog maybe
6:59
it's a SAS business there's no right or
7:02
wrong answer to what you want to buy
7:03
from there once you've established what
7:05
your budget is then the best way to of
7:07
fine potential deals is email people
7:10
reach out the great thing about the
7:12
internet today is relatively easy to
7:13
find out where people are hanging out so
7:15
find them and reach out in a human way
7:17
you don't even in the first message have
7:19
to tell them you want to buy their
7:20
business maybe you just want to have a
7:23
conversation I would definitely avoid a
7:25
generic message because if you want to
7:27
get hold of a busy founder like me for
7:28
example if you reach out and say Hey
7:31
Thomas love what you're building can we
7:33
do a phone call the answer is always
7:34
going to be no if you explain what
7:36
you're doing like hey I'm starting out
7:37
I'm looking to acquire a business yours
7:40
looks like a great fit are you
7:41
interested in a conversation then if it
7:43
is a potential good fit and they're
7:44
interested they will apply to you and
7:46
from there there's no tricks you don't
7:48
have to be technical about it
7:49
particularly if it's a small business if
7:51
you're buying something for ten thousand
7:53
dollars you don't need to hire a firm
7:55
like us you don't need professional
7:57
advice it's really that kind of human
7:59
connection a lot of it's gut feeling I
How to spot good businesses
8:02
want to explore more about what makes a
8:04
good business you've looked at probably
8:05
thousands or tens of thousands of
8:08
businesses when you see a business and
8:10
you're like
8:11
that's a great business I want to buy
8:13
this business what does that look like
8:15
to you so generally good businesses are
8:18
evergreen by that that means they're
8:20
offering something that's forever going
8:21
to be interesting that doesn't mean the
8:24
product you're selling or the software
8:25
or the information you're giving away
8:27
has to be relevant forever but it does
8:30
mean that the audience you're building
8:32
and the customers You're Building should
8:34
be able to be interested in the niche or
8:36
the industry you're building in Forever
8:38
the second part of that is good
8:40
businesses and great businesses have
8:42
repeat and repair recurring customers
8:45
that doesn't necessarily mean you have
8:47
to build a SAS business where people pay
8:49
you hundred dollars a thousand dollars
8:51
every month to access your product but
8:54
what it probably means if you're selling
8:55
a physical product or a digital product
8:58
or whatever it might be do you have
9:00
people coming back so that could be
9:01
using newsletter that could be you email
9:04
people on a consistent basis so you have
9:06
to have some repeat or recurring
9:07
business doesn't necessarily mean you
9:09
can't build a business without that but
9:11
it's much much easier if you have a
9:13
hundred dollars to spend on marketing
9:14
it's all always better to spend that
9:16
hundred dollars making more out of
9:18
customers you already have rather than
9:20
trying to find new people and persuading
9:22
them to spend money when they don't know
9:24
who you are or what your business is and
9:26
then the third thing that makes a really
9:27
good business is ultimately a business
9:29
that's growing growing businesses have
9:31
advantages for many different reasons
9:33
but particularly when it comes to M A
9:35
and selling your business buyers are
9:37
almost always willing to pay more for a
9:39
company that's growing than a company
9:40
that's not growing
9:42
[Music]
9:45
all right so let's talk successes what
Selling a $10M+ business
9:49
was your most successful deal or at
9:51
least a business that you bought or sold
9:53
that really changed the game for you the
9:55
first deal for us which really moved the
9:57
needle and changed the business into a
9:59
completely different level was the first
10:01
time we sold an eight figure business so
10:03
that means the business is sold for over
10:05
10 million dollars in the m a space at
10:07
that level you start breaking into a
10:09
different level of deals you start
10:11
attracting a different type of client
10:13
and it took a very very long time to get
10:15
to that stage and the nature of M A is
10:17
one you've done one deal it then
10:19
compounds and you do more and more and
10:21
now we regularly close eight figure
10:23
transactions but yeah the very first
10:25
deal over that level was
10:27
at least starting in the industry no one
10:29
was selling businesses over 10 million
10:30
dollars the biggest deals you would see
10:32
would be 100 500 000 maybe a million so
10:37
first deal over 10 million and then it
10:39
really like compounded and snowballed
How he got the 8-figure deal
10:41
from there and what did that deal look
10:42
like or how did it manifest so it
10:44
actually came from a referrer from a a
10:46
past client we'd worked with we had sold
10:48
a smaller business for him and he said
10:50
if I was going to trust anyone with my
10:52
business it would be happy International
10:53
so the client knew we hadn't sold
10:56
anything that big before but because
10:58
they had the referral
11:00
they knew we would do a good job and
11:03
ultimately we did and really the
11:04
difference between selling a
11:06
Million Dollar business and 20 million
11:08
dollar business isn't really that
11:10
different it's slightly more technical
11:12
it takes a bit more time it involves
11:15
generally more attorneys and accountants
11:17
and different third parties but
11:19
fundamentally if you know how to sell
11:21
something for a million you can sell
11:22
same for 20. what kind of commission or
How much profit he makes per deal
11:25
structure do you usually get on a deal
11:26
like that or generally in the m a space
11:28
yes it depends on the size of the deal
11:30
but fees generally on smaller
11:32
transactions start at 15 and then tear
11:35
down so the bigger the business gets the
11:37
lower the fee you get to and that really
11:39
continues to tear up until you have a
11:42
multi-billion dollar business fees will
11:44
be even lower so if you're selling
11:45
something for a hundred thousand dollars
11:48
while it would be too small for us
11:49
you're probably gonna be paying 15 if
11:52
you're selling a business for 100
11:54
million you're going to be paying
11:55
significantly less than that all right
How to value a business
11:57
let's talk pricing and valuation if you
11:59
sell a business is it generally a
12:00
multiple of Revenue or profit or how
12:03
does that look so for most small
12:05
businesses so probably everyone
12:07
listening you generally don't get a
12:08
revenue multiple there's a lot of
12:10
misinformation out there around
12:11
valuations but Revenue multiples are
12:13
uncommon you generally get a multiple of
12:15
profit I think the reason sometimes that
12:17
misinformation gets spread around
12:19
there's a lot of small businesses if
12:21
you're running them by yourself your
12:23
revenue and profit number might be
12:24
really similar we see lots of businesses
12:26
which make fifty thousand dollars a
12:28
month but only have five thousand
12:30
dollars a month in expenses that's fine
12:31
but you're still going to get a multiple
12:33
of profit and that multiple range can
12:35
really vary like the average small
12:37
business is probably in the four to ten
12:40
times annual profit range like really
12:42
good businesses might be higher than
12:43
that like bad businesses might be below
12:46
that or not sellable at all but
12:47
generally you're going to be like the
12:48
middle of that range for the majority of
12:50
businesses particularly if you have
12:51
recurring customers you're growing and
12:55
you're in a space which is going to be
Buying a business VS starting one
12:56
around for a long time
12:59
foreign
13:01
[Music]
13:03
back in the day dream about building a
13:06
business with their own idea but that
13:08
comes with a lot of downsides the idea
13:10
might not work out you lose momentum I
13:12
think there is a lot of upside to buying
13:14
a business rather than starting it so so
13:17
what does that look like to you yeah so
13:19
the worst thing about buying a business
13:20
is you need the money the best thing is
13:23
almost everything else so if you're
13:25
buying a business assuming it's making
13:27
some money and you shouldn't buy a
13:28
business if it isn't making money
13:29
depending on your skill set you might
13:32
identify saying that the existing owner
13:34
has done a good job of you don't really
13:37
know much about or saying they haven't
13:39
done much of you can do a really good
13:41
job with so a good example might be a
13:43
software business people buy good
13:46
software businesses which are small the
13:49
founder of the business is extremely
13:50
technical but they don't know how to do
13:52
marketing so if you're a good marketer
13:53
you can take that business which has
13:55
traction you can build doesn't even need
13:57
to be multiple marketing campaigns you
13:59
can build as SEO campaigns social media
14:02
campaigns email campaigns whatever it
14:04
might be to build that business but the
14:06
variable you're never worrying about is
14:08
will someone pay for it because it
14:10
already has an audience and does the
14:12
product work because again it's already
14:14
got people paying for it so that's
14:16
generally the best way to approach
14:17
saying if you're going to buy it buy
14:19
something where your skill set can add
14:21
to it you don't necessarily need to have
14:22
the same skills as the founder ideally
14:25
you need to have slightly different
How to negotiate
14:26
skills all right let's talk about
14:27
negotiation everyone's thinking about
14:29
that when they go to buy how can you get
14:31
the best price as a buyer and sell for
14:33
the most as a seller how does
14:35
negotiation typically work in your
14:37
experience the thing with negotiation is
14:39
firstly negotiation is a really useful
14:41
skill to learn because you can use it in
14:44
every single part of your life that
14:45
doesn't mean I'm suggesting you go into
14:47
a grocery store and start negotiating
14:49
the price of apples but you can do many
14:51
many different things if you're a good
14:53
negotiator when it comes to buying or
14:54
selling a business the first thing to
14:56
think about as a seller or a buyer it
14:58
doesn't matter which side of the table
14:59
you're on is what are you trying to
15:01
achieve is it the most money possible in
15:04
your bank account if you're a seller is
15:06
it the least amount of transition time
15:08
possible as a seller is it you want to
15:10
sell to someone who's going to maintain
15:12
the business as you have been and keep
15:14
the same team and then often as a seller
15:16
it's a bit of a trade-off you will get
15:18
multiple offers on the table and all of
15:21
them will be different you won't have
15:22
two offers which are exactly the same so
15:24
you might have one buyer who offers you
15:26
the most cash but they want the longest
15:28
transition period so they want you to
15:30
work for them for two years and then you
15:32
might get another offer which is
15:34
slightly lower amount cash but they're
15:37
happy for you to leave the business in
15:38
three months so when it comes to
15:39
negotiating and approaching that
15:41
negotiation you need to decide what
15:43
matters to you the most if you don't
15:45
know the worst thing to do is just
15:47
pushing back on every point and that's
15:50
the same with any negotiation if someone
15:52
sends you a list of 10 things they want
15:54
if you argue back on all of those 10
15:57
points you're far less likely to be
15:59
successful the best way to approach it
16:01
with any negotiation particularly when
16:03
it comes to business is go through the
16:05
list decide what you care about and
16:07
decide where you want to pick battles
16:08
and realize that it's important you give
16:11
the other side buyer or seller some wins
16:13
but I've always found the best way to
16:15
approach it is decide what you want
16:16
decide what the most important things to
16:18
negotiate on for you and hopefully the
16:21
best negotiations work where the things
16:24
that mattered most to you as a buyer and
16:25
most of me as a seller are different so
16:27
I push on what I care about you push on
16:30
what you care about and we meet
16:31
somewhere in the middle if that's the
16:32
best way to approach negotiation you're
How to buy a business from scratch
16:34
you're doing big things now and you have
16:36
a lot of capital at your disposal but
16:38
what would be your advice for someone
16:39
who has no money and wants to buy their
16:43
first business or flip their first
16:44
business as you did in your early career
16:46
so first thing
16:47
don't necessarily decide it has to be a
16:49
business you can find anything to flip
16:51
and then the second thing is you need to
16:53
find some money so I don't care where
16:56
you find it but you need at least
16:57
something so either go get a job for a
16:59
few days and make some money borrow some
17:01
money or do something to get you access
17:03
to some Capital it's significantly
17:05
easier to do deals if you have a hundred
17:07
dollars versus zero dollars because very
17:10
few people are willing to give you
17:11
anything for zero whereas a hundred
17:13
dollars you have lots of different
17:14
options you can buy from there the most
17:17
important thing when you're starting out
17:18
is like learning a process and learning
17:20
how to make some money there's lots of
17:22
people that will tell you can do this
17:24
but it's unlikely you don't need to turn
17:25
a hundred dollars into a million it's
17:27
perfectly fine to buy something turn
17:30
that 100 into 150 or 200 or 300 and you
17:35
also early on regardless of what you're
17:37
buying selling you shouldn't worry about
17:40
something that's necessarily going to
17:42
make you a living or even worth your
17:43
time by the hour because all you're
17:45
really done trying to do is learn the
17:47
process you're learning how to sell
17:49
you're learning how to negotiate you're
17:51
building up subject matter expertise you
17:54
are not going to make your living
17:55
long-term buying things for a hundred
17:57
dollars and selling them for 200 but you
18:00
will do if you can apply that same skill
18:02
to buy for a million and solve 2 million
18:04
or 10 million and sell for 20 million
18:06
but you have to start somewhere if you
18:08
don't get any Capital to do the first
18:10
deal it's going to be difficult and if
18:12
you don't learn the process it's going
18:13
to be difficult as well so start small
18:15
appreciate the first couple of deals
18:17
you're going to do the goal is just to
18:19
make a profit it doesn't matter how much
18:21
that profit is some profit over time if
18:24
you ever want to work with investors for
18:25
example investors are much more likely
18:28
to work with people who can show a track
18:30
record even if the track record is small
18:32
if you can show hey look look how many
18:34
times I've turned ten thousand dollars
18:36
into twenty thousand I'm trying to build
18:38
something bigger will you back me
18:40
if that's what you want to do there'll
18:41
be options for you yeah

this guy made 11 million dollars in two
0:02
years with just one product how by
0:05
capitalizing on one of the biggest
0:06
marketing opportunities in years user
0:09
generated content Oliver brocato started
0:12
tabs chocolate in his college apartment
0:13
just two years later he was a
0:15
millionaire by age 21. I pretty much
0:18
drained my entire bank account to go all
0:20
in on this business we met up with
0:22
Oliver and he broke down exactly how
0:23
he's built an 11 million dollar brand
0:25
how he runs it with zero employees and
0:27
why he created a product the world has
0:29
never seen before so I saw sex chocolate
0:31
on the internet the secret behind this
0:33
business lies within a loophole in The
0:35
Tick Tock algorithm and Oliver breaks
0:37
down exactly how he's leveraged
0:39
user-generated content to take advantage
0:41
of that loophole I've created my own
0:43
content machine where every day hundreds
0:46
of videos are going out and reaching
0:47
millions of people which in turn is
0:49
responsible for the 11 million dollars
0:51
plus we're going to do this year Oliver
0:53
is proof that anyone can turn a one
0:55
product brand into millions with one
0:57
marketing strategy I'm Pat walls and
0:59
this is darker story
The $11M Business
1:02
all right Albert tell us what business
1:04
you built and how much money you make
1:05
yeah man um so I sell sex chocolate on
1:08
the internet in essence we created an
1:10
edible for sex we took the most popular
1:12
and effective natural supplements that
1:14
typically come in a pill or powder
1:16
format and we transformed it into a very
1:18
luxurious high-end experience this year
1:21
we're gonna do about 11 million dollars
1:23
in Revenue so it's pretty incredible how
1:24
far we've come no outside Investments
1:26
I've just been constantly reinvesting
1:28
every dollar back in to fuel the growth
How he found the idea
1:31
sex chocolate is a wild product idea it
1:33
really it really stands out and starts a
1:35
conversation how did you come up with
1:36
the idea for this my body was scrolling
1:38
Tick Tock one day he was taking and he
1:40
saw this video posted by some like
1:42
teenage girl uh reviewing a sex
1:44
chocolate and he sent me the video and
1:46
eight million views two million likes
1:48
and I go to look up the product online
1:50
and they don't even have a website
1:52
didn't have a social media page didn't
1:53
have an Instagram enough Tick Tock and I
1:55
was like yup this concept is absolutely
1:57
brilliant clearly they've already
1:59
validated that it can go viral if I were
2:02
to take my prior experience and
2:04
background in this space I can make this
2:06
into a multi-million dollar brand I then
2:08
ended up spending a year you know like
2:10
building this out the right way
2:11
agonizing over every single little
2:14
detail in order to create the best
Viral psychology
2:16
customer experience there's a million
2:17
products you can pick why sex chocolate
2:19
yeah we knew from the start that we were
2:21
going to be able to take this from zero
2:23
to 100 super fast we had the experience
2:26
we had the skill set we had the
2:28
knowledge and the marketing sauce it was
2:30
just now about finding a product that
2:31
would you know intrinsically go viral
2:33
and that's exactly what tabs is you're
2:35
scrolling you know through Tick Tock all
2:36
day you see sex chocolate what like it's
2:39
it's super novel people have never seen
2:41
it before right and so it invokes some
2:43
sort of reaction which is the key to
2:45
going battle is you know something what
2:47
they call emotional arousal making the
2:48
viewer feel something and it doesn't
2:50
matter what you're making them feel it
2:51
just you need to make them feel like a
2:53
super intense emotion and that's what
2:55
invokes people to eight watch the entire
2:57
thing and then like share with their
2:59
friends which creates in turn Virality
How to create product from scratch
3:01
let's talk manufacturing and working
3:04
with suppliers how do you get something
3:06
that's in your head an idea and turn it
3:08
into this yeah absolutely you know
3:11
there's first the Box itself we had to
3:13
like design that kind of raw files I was
3:15
designing them myself on canva and figma
3:17
and then we sent it over to a
3:19
professional designer to really clean it
3:20
up then we have to get 3D renders made
3:22
and then we sent it over to our
3:24
manufacturer in China the boxes are made
3:26
in China the chocolate and anything that
3:28
touches the chocolate is made in the
3:30
United States that's super super
3:31
important to me uh you know in terms of
3:33
the Box itself once we have the design
3:35
file once we had the 3D render we sent
3:37
it over to them and they made their
3:38
first prototype and then there's the
3:40
chocolate itself in order to create the
3:42
chocolate they're like four or five
3:43
different Niche supplement manufacturers
3:46
you know each supplement has its own
3:48
independent manufacturer because we
3:49
Source the best of the best and then
3:51
each chocolate is wrapped in a plastic
3:53
that has its own you know manufacturer
3:55
and then you know the chocolate doesn't
3:56
just spawn in this format there's our
3:58
logo the two T's over here and then
4:00
there's a clean brick so that you know
4:02
you can break it and split it right I
4:04
mean I don't know get away from you
4:08
oh
4:10
but yeah I mean that's kind of what the
4:11
whole entire
4:13
um you know supply chain looks like and
Shipping & Logistics Mistakes
4:14
tell me about some of those mistakes
4:16
that you made in the moving pieces what
4:18
are like the top three Melodies uh
4:21
Inventory management yeah yeah so I
4:24
could tell you like right off the bat um
4:26
when we sold out we decided to ship our
4:28
next order of Boxes by but the reason
4:31
being is that when you ship it by boat
4:32
it's a lot a lot cheaper than shipping
4:34
it airfry but it also takes four times
4:36
as long so we ordered you know like I
4:38
think it was like 60 or 70 000 boxes and
4:40
it was a disaster the container got
4:42
delayed and so you know as a result we
4:44
basically just put everything on pause
4:46
we moved to pre-orders but you know
4:48
sales just decline decline decline
4:49
almost went to zero so you know there
4:51
have been many many times where we've
4:53
run out of chocolate or we weren't able
4:55
to forecast demand properly so what
4:57
we've been trying to do is just order as
4:58
much inventory as we possibly can and
5:00
it's which is why we've been reinvesting
5:01
every dollar back into buying as many
5:03
boxes and chocolates so that we can
5:05
hopefully be prepared but it's been a
5:07
Perpetual problem in fact in our first
5:09
year of business we we were out of stock
5:11
for more months than we had stock and we
5:13
still put up like four million dollars
5:15

Building a Brand VS Dropshipping
6:06
let's talk about the power of a brand
6:08
there's a lot of people on YouTube that
6:10
talk about Drop Shipping and how it's
6:12
easy to get started what's the
6:14
difference between what you're doing and
6:16
Drop Shipping everybody that you see on
6:17
YouTube like perpetuates like this Drop
6:19
Shipping story like oh like you want to
6:22
get rich overnight like make money Drop
6:24
Shipping the only people making money
6:25
through this Drop Shipping thing are the
6:27
people that are selling the courses like
6:30
secret for you it's the YouTuber that's
6:32
behind the camera that's like get into
6:33
jobs you're getting into jobs like not
6:34
like they're the only ones profiting on
6:36
that Drop Shipping sucks you're selling
6:39
a trendy product in an incredibly
6:41
saturated market and you have no
6:43
competitive Advantage why is the
6:44
consumer going to buy it from you versus
6:46
buying it from Amazon why are they going
6:47
to buy it from you versus you know
6:49
buying it from the other 150 sellers
6:51
that are Drop Shipping the Sim exact the
6:53
answer is that they're not the power of
6:55
the brand is dropping a product on your
6:58
website and in 30 seconds it's sold out
7:00
the power of the brand is creating a
7:02
community and like an identity uh you
7:04
know between you and your consumer where
7:07
they live and breathe and die for your
7:09
when you unlock something like that
7:12
you made it because it doesn't matter
7:15
what you sell it doesn't matter what you
7:16
drop you got a cult like following and
7:18
on a business sense what that means is
7:21
that you have Evergreen customers
7:23
forever so like when you have new
7:25
product drops when you introduce new
7:27
skus like you know that people are
7:29
coming back and you're going to be able
7:30
to make money off of this customer
7:32
cohort time and time again on top of
7:34
that you know with the brand You're
7:36
Building equity
7:37
the people that make money I'm talking
7:39
real money they don't make it off the
7:41
cash flow they don't make it off the
7:42
yearly sales they're making it off the
7:44
exit with Drop Shipping there is no
7:47
brand equity which puts you in this
7:49
really difficult spot to ever build any
7:51
sort of thing that's concrete or build
7:53
anything that's of real value because
7:55
every two months you're you're closing
7:57
down shop opening a new shop closing
7:58
down shop opening a new shop so at the
8:00
end of the day people that are thinking
8:02
long term and people that are focused on
8:03
building brands are always going to win
The early days
8:05
all right man you're a young guy only 21
8:07
years old with massive success made
8:10
Millions take me through your minds at
8:11
the time where you really did decide
8:13
okay
8:14
I'm gonna start something what was
8:16
really kind of like the impetus was
8:18
Christmas break when I was a freshman in
8:20
college you know it was at the time and
8:22
so there was like this two-month break
8:24
between first semester and second
8:25
semester and so you know during that
8:27
break I'm back at home I'm like sitting
8:29
around my house and I was like this is
8:31
like the perfect time and opportunity to
8:33
build something and so I did just that
8:35
and it took it took a year to go from
8:38
idea to bring it into reality you know
8:41
it was super slow like I'm not going to
8:43
sugarcoat it like there were weeks where
8:44
I wasn't even working on the business
8:45
because I was waiting on this person or
8:47
I was waiting on this to get done I was
8:48
waiting on this thing for this thing
8:49
like you know it didn't just like kind
8:51
of like materialize overnight it was a
8:53
long long long process but once we had
8:56
product in hand and we had an incredible
8:59
product that you know I poured my Blood
9:00
Sweat and Tears into over that year we
9:02
hit the ground running and in our first
9:04
three weeks we sold out of all of our
9:05
inventory and in our first month we had
9:07
to move to pre-order and we did over 280
9:10
000 in Revenue at like 50 net margins
9:13
because we were just going viral left
9:15
and right it was absolutely Bonkers and
9:17
so you know from that point on like I
9:19
knew that I had something and I knew
9:21
that I had to like see it through in
9:23
order to take it to the next level all
Costs
9:24
right let's talk startup costs how much
9:26
did it cost to start tabs and how much
9:28
does it cost to start an e-commerce
9:29
business so I started tabs with thirty
9:31
thousand dollars total I pretty much
9:33
drained my entire bank account which
9:35
came from like all my previous Ventures
9:36
from when I was younger to go all in on
9:38
this business so like I don't know if
9:40
that would be like the average business
9:42
I think that like honestly you could
9:44
probably start anything like any sort of
9:46
econ brand at least with an MVP with
9:48
like 10 grand I think like the the
9:49
biggest cost the r d side of things
9:52
right like the research and development
9:54
of the the product itself eh and then B
9:57
like in terms of like developing that
9:58
sample like that first initial sample
10:00
once you have that down it's then about
10:02
finding a manufacturer that's willing to
10:04
work with you because here's the deal a
10:06
lot of Manufacturers don't give you the
10:08
time of day because you're too small so
10:09
if you could find a manufacturer like a
10:11
small guy that's like willing to kind of
10:13
take you under their wing and like that
10:14
on you you can you can for sure make
How to find manufacturer's
10:16
something happen for sub 10 grand yeah
10:17
how do you find a small manufacturer
10:19
that will take a bet on you yeah Google
10:21
man everything everything is at our
10:24
fingertips I literally typed in on
10:26
Google chocolate contract manufacturer I
10:29
went through all the pages on Google
10:31
like the first 20 or 25 pages I made a
10:34
spreadsheet you know collecting their
10:35
information their name their website
10:37
link I was just ringing them up I would
10:39
just literally like make phone calls and
10:40

The Viral Strategy
10:42

10:48
[Music]
10:51
let's talk about marketing I know you've
10:53
done hundreds of millions of views on
10:55
Tick Tock and you make most of your
10:57
business through short form social media
10:59
yeah can you tell me more about how that
11:00
works yeah I basically had like hundreds
11:02
of people that are on my payroll and
11:04
they're pushing out content every single
11:06
day they're putting up videos on tick
11:08
tock on Instagram on YouTube any short
11:11
form platform you can imagine I'm on it
11:13
and so through that I've created my own
11:15
content machine where every day hundreds
11:18
of videos are going out and reaching
11:19
millions of people which in turn drives
11:22
tens hundreds of thousands of dollars in
11:24
sales a day and you know on a macro
11:25
level is responsible for the 11 million
11:28
dollars plus we're going to do this year
11:30
and so you actually have a bunch of
11:32
people that just make content for you
11:33
yeah dude I have like over like 60
11:35
people that make content out of
11:37
thousands of people that like post the
11:39
content across a web of accounts what
Viral Video Formula
11:41
kind of videos are they yeah so I try to
11:43
make them seem as native as possible
11:46
consumers are smart if they think it's
11:48
an app they're not going to watch it so
11:50
I make the videos like super on par with
11:53
whatever's trending in the moment
11:54
whatever sound is popping whatever like
11:56
movement is happening like whatever it
11:58
is like my creators are making content
12:01
around that and then of course we have
12:02
some like validated Concepts that like
12:05
push really hard but yeah that's pretty
Other marketing channels
12:07
much it so you don't do a lot of like
12:08
paid ads not really it's like mostly
12:10
organic it's most like all the content
12:12
creators and the reposters I do double
12:14
and paid where like I take my most model
12:16
creatives and play these meme pages that
12:18
have tens of millions of followers to
12:20
post my content and then I also run a
12:22
little bit of Google ads I do email and
12:24
text message marketing which is more
12:26
like kind of bottom of the funnel but
12:28
yeah I mean for the most part it's a
12:29
pretty uh crazy organic system that I
12:32
pioneered all right to close this

Aired: Sep 27, 2023
In this video, I flew out to Toronto to get the full story of Hush Blankets. Aaron and Leor started this business while working their 9-5's, and they made one of the craziest rebounds I've ever seen from an ecommerce business - the best part, Aaron shared exactly how they did it.

what's your story
0:01
[Music]
0:03
I mean we bootstrapped this thing from
0:05
day one and we need it to be profitable
0:07
we didn't have any money to put in we
0:08
couldn't afford to lose this is Aaron
0:11
Spivak and he nearly lost everything
0:13
launching a business
0:15
at first he thought he was a Founder
0:17
genius we were doing 30k a month 60k a
0:20
month 90k a month but then realized it
0:23
was just beginner's luck you know our
0:25
first summer we went to zero it was a
0:28
moment of like are you guys actually
0:29
going to do this or not so what happens
0:31
when you're staring in the face of
0:33
failure and your bank account is losing
0:35
money every day my co-founder leor
0:37
called me and he's like hey we gotta we
0:39
gotta shut this business down do you
0:40
give up we need to prove that there was
0:42
something here or do you jump even
0:45
further into the abyss and go to the
0:47
ends of the Earth just to find a way to
0:49
make it work we broke the internet we
0:51
went viral on Netflix for doing that for
0:53
the first time ever in that moment I was
0:56
like that's why we storytelling this is
0:58
the story of how two guys from Toronto
1:00
turned four thousand dollars into 48
1:03
million dollars in four years I'm Pat
1:05
walls and this is starter story
The Beginning
1:08
growing up Aaron was your typical young
1:11
entrepreneur hustling and starting just
1:13
about everything lemonade stands party
1:16
buses and even starting his own Juice
1:18
Shop in Toronto but everything changed
1:20
when he met leor his eventual business
1:22
partner he realized there was a bigger
1:24
opportunity starting an online business
1:26
I always wanted to really start a
1:28
business with lior I thought he was just
1:30
super smart he was like in that online
1:31
world I was opening up two shops and
1:34
making smoothie recipes and I actually
1:37
wanted to sell Cricket protein that
1:40
grinded up crickets and I brought it to
1:41
leor and he's like that's disgusting but
1:44
have you seen this rise in weighted
1:47
blankets and then we went on Google and
1:48
we saw that there was 300 000 people
1:50
searching for weighted blankets in the
1:52
coming months with enough proof of
1:54
concept and validation Aaron and lior
1:56
started developing a sample of what they
1:58
thought to be the perfect weighted
1:59
blanket and the wild thing is that they
2:01
were doing all of this while they were
2:03
working their current full-time jobs
2:05
like I was opening my juice shop at 6am
2:07
until like 2 3 clock and then I'd
2:09
probably work out or eat dinner lior was
2:11
running a software company the same time
2:13
frame we'd meet up every day at like
2:14
seven o'clock at his apartment and then
2:16
we'd work till like one two a.m after
2:19
grinding it out for months the plan
2:21
started to fall in place Aaron and lior
2:23
found a new audience to Market these
2:25
weighted blankets to and started running
2:27
ads on Google so we literally with basic
2:30
images in one sample put up a pre-order
2:32
site and then we bought ads for the most
2:35
expensive keyword which was weighted
2:37
blankets first sale came in we made I
2:40
think like 20 bucks the next day we made
2:42
three sales I remember Leo and I took
2:44
those three sales extrapolated over the
2:46
year I'm like oh my God we're gonna buy
2:47
Ferraris like we're rich like this is it
2:49
we were doing 30k a month 60k a month
2:52
90k a month with a little bit of
2:54
beginner's luck they were really
2:56
successful out of the gate we launched
2:57
in January we went from one three five
2:59
sales 20 sales a day but they were not
3:02
ready for what was about to happen and
3:04
our first July in Toronto it's 30
3:07
degrees outside which is the hottest
3:08
month month of the year we went from all
3:11
those sales to literally zero sales most
3:13
days and some days one our best day of
3:15
the month we maybe had two sales Aaron
3:17
and lior had made a huge mistake they
3:19
didn't forecast their inventory for the
3:21
summer months and this was threatening
3:23
their entire business they were running
3:25
out of cash and sitting on hundreds of
3:27
unsellable inventory lior even came to
3:30
Aaron to shut the business down you know
3:32
our first summer we went to zero my
3:34
co-founder Leo called me he's like hey
3:35
we gotta we gotta shut this business
3:37
down because I'm not interested in a
3:39
seasonal business we have a seasonal
3:40
product we're stuck with all this
3:41
inventory let's get rid of it as fast as
3:44
possible and you know you've got juice
3:46
shops he had a software business let's
3:47
move on in those moments it was like
3:49
looking yourself in the mirror from
3:50
being like
3:51
am I actually the real deal do I wait do
3:54
I actually know what the hell I'm doing
3:55
like do people actually like my
3:58
like was this all an accident the fast
4:00
success started to collapse for Aaron in
4:02
lior and the dark thoughts came pouring
4:05
in as their bank accounts came closer to
4:07
zero so because we were broke it was one
4:10
of the most challenging years of our
4:12
lives and there was doubt and there was
4:14
uncertainty I mean we bootstrapped this
4:16
thing from day one and we need it to be
4:19
profitable we didn't want to we didn't
4:20
have any money to put in we couldn't
4:22
afford to lose it was a moment of like
4:25
are you guys actually going to do this
4:26
or not if even though things were tough
4:28
the boys were determined to figure it
4:30
out but with money running out they had
4:33
to do something quickly and this is when
4:35
Aaron had a brilliant idea we needed to
4:37
prove that there was something here that
4:40
someone wanted to buy this product and
4:42
once they got the product that they were
4:44
happy with it we weren't just good
4:46
marketers with shitty product it got to
4:48
the point where I was like hey why don't
4:49
we just call everyone because clearly
4:50
they were buying it they're not buying
4:52
it now why are they not buying well just
4:54
ask and that's exactly what they do in
The Breakthrough
4:57
August of 2018 they sent out an email to
5:00
all of their customers with a calendly
5:01
link their goal to talk to every single
5:04
one of their customers and ask them why
5:06
they stopped buying the blankets every
5:08
single person said the exact same thing
5:10
Aaron we love the blanket it's so
5:13
amazing it's it's incredible but I'm
5:15
sweating in places I've never sweat
5:17
before it's disgusting so I'm putting it
5:20
in my closet and in the winter I'll pull
5:22
it back out and this is when Aaron and
5:24
Leora have the biggest breakthrough in
5:25
their Journey instead of launching a
5:27
product and hoping for the best they
5:29
realized the secret to building a
5:31
business is talking to customers and it
5:34
was like a light bulb moment where we're
5:35
like wait a second
5:37
why don't we just make a cooling
5:38
weighted blanket because if it was
5:40
cooling you would use it all year round
5:41
like of course we would of course we
5:42
would so we spent all of September
5:45
flying around talking to suppliers and
5:47
sourcing the coolest fabric ever we
5:49
ended up having to create our own fabric
5:51
which is called the ice fabric which is
5:53
the coolest Fabric in the world it
5:56
literally keeps you cold without any
5:57
water or fans going through your bed but
6:00
it was so expensive it was a hundred
6:01
thousand dollars to get the first roll
6:03
of that fabric and we couldn't afford it
The Kickstarter
6:06
Aaron and leor are faced with their
6:08
biggest challenge yet they need a
6:10
boatload of cash to make more blankets
6:12
but they're down to their last four
6:14
thousand dollars because they wanted to
6:16
stay bootstrapped and keep 100 of the
6:18
business investors were off the table so
6:21
they decide to throw a Hail Mary and try
6:23
raising a few thousand bucks on
6:25
Kickstarter they set a very low goal of
6:28
25 000 in hopes it will be enough to
6:31
keep the business alive and make their
6:32
next order when the kickstarter goes
6:34
live something amazing happens the boys
6:37
raised over one million dollars in the
6:40
first 30 days so in 2019 we launched the
6:43
1.0 the hush ice the world's coolest
6:45
weighted blanket it was a top 10
6:47
Canadian Kickstarter of all time and
6:49
when people ask us like what was the
6:51
hack how did you reverse engineer
6:53
Kickstarter like what it was what was it
6:54
a specific agency or a video style and
6:57
it's like no I mean I had 3 000 people
7:00
that literally told me on the phone that
7:03
they would buy it if I made it Aaron and
7:05
Leora realized they need to take the
7:06
momentum from their Kickstarter and push
7:08
it into something even bigger they sit
7:10
down and ask themselves this question
7:12
how can we get these weighted blankets
7:14
in front of a massive audience they come
7:16
up with a plan they're gonna weasel
7:18
their way into one of the biggest shows
7:19
on television that year we then went on
7:23
Canadian hit TV show Dragon's Den and we
7:25
went on the show told our story and had
7:28
in 14 Seasons so 14 years of the show
7:31
there's never been a pitch that came on
7:33
and increased their evaluation on live
7:35
TV through debate amongst the dragons
7:37
and we were the first we broke the
7:40
internet we went viral on Netflix for
7:42
doing that for the first time ever it
7:44
catapulted the brand as 2020 comes
The 2020s
7:47
around the boys continue to double down
7:49
on their success reinvesting every
7:51
dollar they earn they pick up the phone
7:53
again and continue talking to customers
7:55
and this gives them a new idea to create
7:58
a new product a pillow they call
8:01
thousands of customers and get feedback
8:03
on what would make the perfect pillow
8:05
then they launch it on their email list
8:07
and sell 3 000 pillows in 72 hours and I
8:11
remember I post about it on LinkedIn I'm
8:12
like hey we just sold out 3000 pills in
8:14
72 hours and everyone's initial reaction
8:16
is like what was the marketing what was
8:18
the email what was the hype what was the
8:20
flow and it's like well no actually
8:22
retired last year we were talking to our
8:24
customers literally asking them what
8:26
pillow you want let me build it for you
8:27
they realize they have a formula talk to
8:30
customers understand their problems and
8:32
then create more products to sell them
8:34
so they do the same thing and launch the
8:36
hush ice blanket 0.0 and then do the
8:38
same thing again and launch the hush ice
8:40
bed sheets that year they do 20 million
8:43
in sales we over doubled the business
8:46
again heading into 21 where we just said
8:50
it's time to shine we want big goals we
8:52
wanted to do 40 million bucks we really
8:54
wanted to sell the business at that time
8:55
with big plans to sell the business
8:57
Aaron and leor need to find a final
9:00
product to create that will increase
9:01
their valuation so they decide to do
9:04
something that nobody expects in an
9:06
industry where it's nearly impossible to
9:08
make a profit we have the stupidest idea
9:11
in the world which was to launch a
9:13
mattress in a box no one makes money
9:15
selling mattresses in a box but for
9:17
whatever reason we thought we could and
9:20
we spent three months calling customers
9:21
because we were so nervous so expensive
9:23
the inventory was so expensive so for
9:25
the next few months they of course spend
9:28
all of their time calling up their
9:30
customers and asking them what would
9:31
make the perfect mattress and to their
9:34
surprise the biggest pain point was that
9:36
their current mattresses were super
9:38
uncomfortable when it came to making
9:40
love so we went out we created a
9:43
specific Zone technology that has
9:45
specific Springs and specific areas that
9:47
keep you flat no matter how you're
9:49
positioned or how you're leaning up
9:50
against something we did a million and a
9:52
half dollars on launch which nobody
9:54
believed that we can do then in October
The 2021s
9:57
of 2021 the biggest sleep company in
10:00
Canada gives them a call they want to
10:02
acquire hush blankets we sold the
10:04
business to the largest sleep company in
10:06
the country we went from zero to 48
10:08
million and 48 months and it's been a
10:11
really fun ride along their Journey
10:12
Aaron and Leora learned hundreds of
10:15
lessons but there's one lesson that
10:17
stands out and it's something they
10:18
didn't realize until they sat down and
10:20
really looked back all of these phone
10:22
calls and customer conversations created
10:25
a community of super fans customers that
10:27
would buy from them forever and it's
10:30
actually what makes hush stand out from
10:32
the thousands of other companies selling
10:34
the same products we opened our first
10:36
pop-up store the highest grossing Mall
10:38
in the country fourth in all of North
10:39
America and aloe also decided to come to
10:42
Canada open the same time as us and they
10:45
had 700 people come through their door
10:47
on opening day we had 1500 and who came
10:49
our people there's a blanket behind you
10:52
someone's had a sign their blanket and
10:54
they gave it back to us as a souvenir
10:56
one of the executives from the company
10:57
that purchased us was there watched it
10:59
happen in real time and came up to me
11:01
after he's like I've never in my 25
11:04
years in this industry would think that
11:07
someone would ask a guy that sells
11:09
blankets to sign the blanket in that
11:11
moment I was like that's why we
11:14
storytelled today customers care more
11:16
about the people behind a brand than
11:18
they do about the product itself Aaron
11:21
and Leora documented their journey and
11:22
got customers involved from the start
11:24
they weren't just selling blankets and
11:26
pillows they were bringing their
11:28
customers along for the ride being
11:30
vulnerable and sharing all the ups and
11:32
the downs I think storytelling is the
11:34
most important thing you can have when
11:35
you're marketing a brand and
11:37
storytelling is the emotions and it's
11:39
the magic that people want to feel
11:41
before they go out and purchase
11:43
something like if you think about
11:44
Abercrombie walking into a mall there's
11:47
two shirtless teenagers with six packs
11:50
labs and cologne that's like oozing out
11:53
and we're all like yeah that's us you
11:56
know and like now that story doesn't
11:58
resonate but that's who we wanted to be
12:00
we wanted to be that guys with the cool
12:02
hair and the six-pack ads that the girl
12:04
loves and that we smell good and we we
12:06
walked into the store we bought those
12:08
jeans and we put them on and we felt
12:10
like those guys that Essence that
12:13
emotion that magic is everything when
12:15
building a brand people can have that
12:17
feeling with small Brands and small
12:18
businesses and I don't know why I don't
12:21
know why Founders are are not leaning
12:23
into that perhaps they think it's
12:25
beneath them but that's how you build
12:26
community from four thousand dollars in
12:28
the bank to 48 million dollars Aaron and
12:31
Leora have proved that thanks to the
12:33
internet anyone can build something huge
12:35
as long as you're willing to pick up the
12:37
phone and tell your story anything is
12:40
possible what the internet afforded us
12:42
was guys like me are able to go and
12:46
compete with the big guys because the
12:47
internet
12:48
previously you needed to go and knock
12:50
doors of these retailers and beg for
12:52
them to take your product they'd put you
12:53
in a shitty Corner no one would try to
12:54
have no sales you have returned and like
12:57
it was the barrier to entry was so big
12:59
but now there's a story for the underdog
13:02
there's a story for the guys shooting on
13:04
their cell phone that gets to be that
13:05
way
13:06
I do that to me

Title: He Built A $2.5M/Year Business In 2 Years
Show: Starter Story
Host: Pat Walls
Aired: Oct 4, 2023
In this video, I'm in Chicago to meet Dylan and Henry - two college roommates who built a $2M/Year business to fund their creative dreams. They share their strategies for landing BIG clients (Ali Abdaal, Will Smith, Naval...), AND the secret that has gotten them over 1 billion views on YouTube. But the best part about their business - they optimize for fun first... THEN for money.

Carl Hughes built a $2.5 million year
0:02
business in just two years with one
0:04
strategy putting ourselves in people's
0:06
minds as the premium provider he invited
0:08
us into his home in Chicago to show us
0:10
exactly how he did it and how he found a
0:13
niche where he could charge tens of
0:14
thousands of dollars per month to just a
0:16
handful of clients but before he started
0:19
the business Carl was plagued by
0:21
self-doubt I just didn't have the
0:22
confidence to think I could do it I
0:24
didn't believe I was the kind of person
0:25
who could start their own company now
0:27
he's running multiple million dollar
0:29
businesses with a 10year goal to hit a
0:31
$100 million in total revenue and his
0:34
plan to reach that goal has nothing to
0:35
do with starting new businesses I got to
0:37
meet a couple people who had done this
0:39
thing called entrepreneurship through
0:41
acquisition in this video Carl shares
0:43
what most people get wrong when they go
0:44
to start a productize service and he
0:47
gives a step-by-step breakdown of how he
0:49
would start all over again with nothing
0:51
I initially started draft dodev not even
0:53
as a company there was no website there
0:54
was no landing page I'm Pat walls and
0:57
this is starter
0:58
story yeah thanks for having me dude
1:01
good to see you Pat tell me about who
1:02
you are and what you built my name is
1:03
Carl Hughes I run draft. deev primarily
1:06
and then actually just recently bought a
1:08
second business I'll start with draft.
1:09
Dev what we do there is we create
1:11
technical content aimed at software
1:13
Engineers for marketing purposes so this
1:14
is for companies that want to reach
1:15
software developers we've grown in 3
1:17
years to over $2.5 million in Revenue
1:19
we've got a full-time team of six or
1:21
seven and then hundreds of contractors
1:23
literally hundreds around the world in
1:24
54 countries so that's where I'm at
1:26
today wow and so how does that work how
1:28
does the service work draft. essentially
1:30
what clients will do is they'll come to
1:31
us and buy a package of 12 24 48 pieces
1:35
of content that they're going to publish
1:36
on their site typically blog posts
1:38
tutorials things like that and then what
1:40
we'll do is go through the process of
1:41
finding or using our writer pool who are
1:43
all software Engineers that are
1:44
practicing day-to-day to write this
1:46
content for them pair them up with good
1:47
editors they'll clean up their work we
1:49
have Tech reviewers and staff so
1:50
full-time Engineers that also check
1:52
their work and then we get stuff back to
1:53
clients on a weekly or twice a week
1:55
basis yeah and what's the type of client
1:57
or company that pays or something like
1:58
this yeah so when we started out is a
2:00
lot of early stage startups that were
2:01
just kind of trying to get their first
2:03
marketing efforts underway now what we
2:05
tend to do is work with bigger more
2:06
established companies so some of our
2:07
headline clients might be places like
2:10
red panda Cloud flare Dropbox we've
2:13
worked with a lot of big Brands who are
2:14
trying to reach Developers for one
2:16
reason or another and so any company
2:17
that wants to sell things to developers
2:19
usually it's like software tools like
2:21
idees or um testing tools or could be
2:24
security tools all that kind of stuff
2:26
you want to sell to a really technical
2:28
audience and so you have to build
2:29
Authority with them you have to build
2:30
trust and one of the best ways to do
2:32
that is through content whether it's
2:33
written or video or you know some mix of
2:36
both tell me about your backstory how
2:37
did you get into this business back in
2:39
college I studied mechanical engineering
2:40
and minor in business I initially
2:42
thought I'd go work for a really big
2:44
company I did internships with GE and
2:46
seens like huge companies multinational
2:48
um and it was the most boring I've
2:50
ever done in my life so like I was like
2:51
I got to get out of here my dad was an
2:53
entrepreneur I had an uncle who was an
2:54
entrepreneur they were smalltime local
2:56
business owners but like you know they
2:57
had that freedom they had the lifestyle
2:59
that I was looking for more I started to
3:00
look into that I started look into
3:01
internet entrepreneurship I learned how
3:03
to code on my you know my free time I
3:05
started picking up some freelance gigs
3:06
making WordPress sites just for on the
3:08
side so I came out of school I moved to
3:10
Chicago I worked with this small company
3:11
called uloop I was there for a couple
3:13
years and then I got a job as the first
3:15
engineer at a company called packback I
3:16
left about four years into that to go
3:19
join an early stage startup called the
3:21
grade Network and then about 3 years
3:22
into that Co hit and that was just the
3:24
game changer that's kind of forced me
3:26
into entrepreneurship so I was looking
3:28
for something to do like I got to fill
3:30
my time a but I also want to make some
3:31
money and contribute to the family I
3:33
initially started draft. deev not even
3:35
as a company there was no website there
3:36
was no landing page there was nothing it
3:38
was a single page on my personal website
3:40
called Carl's writing and I would send
3:42
that around to people and say Here's a
3:43
bunch of things I've written recently
3:44
would you pay me to write for you I sent
3:46
that around to all these people in my
3:47
network I I reached out to people
3:49
randomly I started to have phone calls
3:50
with people who worked in these fields
3:53
uh called developer relations which I
3:54
never even knew about before that and I
3:56
started to figure out that oh maybe
3:57
there is more demand for this and there
3:58
is there is something here so you know
4:00
that kind of started in 2020 with me
4:01
freelancing writing a few articles here
4:03
and there within 3 months I had way more
4:06
work than I could handle and I started
4:07
to hire people and I you know sort of
4:09
phased out of my old job so your Niche
4:11
developer relations content is super
4:13
unique how did you find this Niche and
4:16
what's your advice to others that are
4:17
watching that are looking for the right
4:19
Niche yeah when it comes to finding a
4:20
niche it wasn't super intentional on my
4:22
part I didn't have this like formula
4:24
where I was going out there and figuring
4:25
out exactly what I'm looking for but it
4:27
was more like is this something I like
4:29
doing in interested in and as I talk to
4:31
customers are they willing to actually
4:32
pay for it it's really easy to miss that
4:34
because a lot of people just pursue the
4:35
things they're interested in that have
4:37
no potential monation or they pursue
4:39
only what customers want to pay for but
4:41
they don't care about it at all they
4:42
have no interest or knowledge in that
4:43
space and that's super hard to stand out
4:45
into let's talk about getting your first
4:46
customer how did you get your first
4:48
customer your first few customers and
4:50
what would be your advice for others
4:52
looking to get their first customer I
4:53
don't even remember who the very first
4:54
customer was but at least the first 5 to
4:56
10 were all people I had met at some
4:58
point in my profession professional
4:59
Journey before and who I had stayed in
5:01
touch with I have this strategy I came
5:03
up with just after college where I have
5:05
a spreadsheet of about 50 people who I
5:07
just want to keep in touch with who's on
5:09
that list has changed over time is my
5:10
interest have changed what I'm doing but
5:12
I've always had like a weekly reminder
5:14
just go reach out to a couple of those
5:16
people and either have lunch or at least
5:17
send them an email to see how they're
5:19
doing do a quick call and that network
5:21
list has been one of the most powerful
5:23
things in my career it literally got me
5:24
my last two startup jobs it got me
5:26
started with draft dodev and so that
5:28
small amount of effort as much as it
5:30
doesn't pay off quickly was super
5:32
helpful in the long run as starting a
5:33
business talk about the fundamentals of
5:35
a product High service how is your team
5:37
set up in terms of employees contractors
5:40
and partners again it's kind of grown
5:41
over time it started off where we have a
5:43
writer uh and an editor and then I would
5:45
kind of sit in and do all the tech
5:47
reviews is what we call them where I
5:48
just see like is this technically a very
5:50
strong article does it make sense is an
5:52
engineer that's actually like pretty
5:53
experienced going to buy it and
5:55
eventually I hired out a full-time
5:56
engineer to do those tech reviews and
5:58
then a few Engineers that were kind kind
5:59
of helping in out on that the team today
6:01
at draft. Dev is a little smaller than
6:02
we were at our Peak last year just
6:03
because Tech has kind of been in a
6:05
downturn uh VC funding is about a third
6:07
of what it was last year so naturally we
6:10
follow some of that curve um but we've
6:12
still got six full-time team members and
6:14
then uh hundreds of contractors that
6:16
help us out with things like editing
6:18
tech reviews writing uh and then a lot
6:20
of administrative stuff too let's talk
6:22
about marketing as a business scale you
6:23
got it to 100K per year and then you
6:25
took it way bigger to 2.5 million a year
6:28
what are your main way that you marketed
6:30
and scaled a business to the point it is
6:32
today so it divides roughly evenly into
6:34
thirds we've got about a third of our
6:36
business comes in from referrals and
6:37
word of mouth so that's existing clients
6:39
telling their friends their colleagues
6:41
that are in similar businesses or it
6:43
could be an existing client has a
6:45
marketing person that leaves and goes to
6:46
a new company and they kind of bring us
6:47
along for the ride and then the other
6:49
third is going to be organic search and
6:51
social media I kind of lump those
6:53
together because they sort of feed on
6:54
each other but that could be things like
6:56
we write a blog post that ranks for a
6:57
certain term like developer advocate
6:59
what do a developer Advocate or
7:00
something and then we also write a lot
7:02
of social media posts that help kind of
7:03
push people towards that same thing and
7:05
then that last third is cold Outreach
7:07
and just unknown random things that come
7:09
up we've always positioned ourselves as
7:10
the premium service in this Niche
7:12
therefore we don't do a lot of
7:14
discounting we don't do a lot of one-off
7:16
Trials we make people sign quarterly
7:18
commitments and that's all by Design
7:20
like the best agencies when you look at
7:22
the way they do it they don't do little
7:23
one-off work for people and part of it's
7:25
just a nature of our cost like our costs
7:27
are pretty high per article because were
7:29
paying Engineers for their time um but
7:31
at the same time it's also just about
7:33
putting ourselves in people's minds as
7:35
the premium provider that kind of
7:36
carries through to all of our marketing
7:38
and so when people come to us most of
7:40
the time they've heard of us through
7:41
several different channels but you know
7:42
we can kind of attribute it to one
7:44
primary Channel you built this business
7:45
to 2.5 million a year in basically 2
7:49
years how did you learn all the skills
7:51
needed to do that one is I was the first
7:53
employee at two early stage startups so
7:55
I got to go with the founders on the
7:56
journey from like hiring me their first
7:58
employee to growing and raising money
8:01
and doing all the things that Founders
8:02
do in those early days and so that was
8:04
super eye opening gave me a ton of
8:05
insight into what it takes to actually
8:06
start a business it also gave me a lot
8:08
of confidence I think this is something
8:10
that most people when and myself
8:12
included when I was thinking about
8:13
starting a business and trying little
8:15
businesses for years before I got draft.
8:17
Dev to actually work I just didn't have
8:19
the confidence to think I could do it I
8:21
didn't believe I was the kind of person
8:22
who could start their own company and
8:24
seeing Founders do that firsthand who
8:26
were no different than me they weren't
8:28
smarter they weren't more educ ated they
8:29
were able to do it it made me realize
8:31
like oh this is very possible it's not
8:32
as unachievable as you might think and
8:34
that's where like surrounding yourself
8:35
with other entrepreneurs people who are
8:36
maybe one step ahead of you is super
8:38
powerful I spent 7 years trying to build
8:40
24 different businesses the only one of
8:43
them was successful now that business
8:45
makes over a million dollar a year but I
8:47
could have done it a lot faster if I
8:48
studied already successful businesses
8:51
imagine you could read the exact steps
8:53
to how someone built a million-dollar
8:54
business and the mistakes they made so
8:57
you can avoid them when you launch well
8:58
it starts story we have a library of
9:00
over 4,000 case studies and business
9:02
idea breakdowns where you can do this
9:03
All Back by real data for example Luke
9:06
joined starter story in Doven to our
9:07
case study about a newsletter that makes
9:09
$25 million a year just one month later
9:12
he launched his own newsletter and did
9:14
$5,800 in Revenue in 30 days it's simple
9:17
he studied what works implemented it and
9:20
avoided the mistakes of people that were
9:21
just a few steps ahead of him so if
9:23
you're serious about finding a business
9:24
idea that works and making your first
9:26
dollar 10 times faster check out the
9:28
first link in the description we're
9:30
running a special right now for anyone
9:31
coming from the channel anyways enjoy
9:33
the rest of the video peace I also got a
9:35
lot of experiential practice by starting
9:37
little side projects that never really
9:39
took off so I had a ton of these like at
9:41
least 10 of them that I I actually have
9:42
some documentation around of like what I
9:44
tried to do in the business uh how it
9:46
didn't work what I did learn from it all
9:48
these little experiences add up and they
9:50
stack up on top of each other so I think
9:51
it's important as an entrepreneur even
9:54
if you're struggling and going through a
9:55
million different little iterations of
9:57
projects and you're not hitting your
9:58
stride like that's okay that's part of
10:00
the journey and you have to accept that
10:01
and just keep trying anyway if I hadn't
10:04
kept trying then we wouldn't be here
10:05
right so draft. Dev massive success in 2
10:08
years what do you think made it so
10:10
successful I was able to do it part-time
10:12
and kind of get myself like make sure it
10:13
was viable before I went full on into it
10:16
I think that would have been really
10:16
tough to put the pressure on myself to
10:18
like go 100% fulltime Market timing was
10:20
a big factor Co had just happened all
10:23
the tech companies that were doing
10:25
marketing had to redirect their
10:27
conference inperson budgets into
10:29
something cuz they were all getting
10:30
funding still they still had a lot of
10:32
money to play with as we started draft.
10:34
Dev all of a sudden there's just you
10:35
know hundreds and hundreds of thousands
10:37
of dollars being dumped into Marketing
10:39
in a in content in the developer space
10:42
and we were so Niche and so specific
10:44
that we built trust much faster than a
10:47
company that was just a general purpose
10:48
content agency would have done so with
10:50
draft. Dev you prove that the model
10:52
works and now you bought another product
10:54
High service can you tell me more about
10:55
that yeah for sure Pat last year when
10:57
draft. Dev was growing I was able take a
10:59
whole month off when my second son was
11:00
born and I I kind of had this like
11:03
existential crisis like what am I doing
11:05
and what do I what am I building this
11:06
for like what's the point because I had
11:08
kind of achieved the goal that I set out
11:10
to at the beginning which was take a
11:11
month off and the company runs without
11:13
me I got to meet a couple people who had
11:14
done this this thing called
11:16
entrepreneurship through acquisition
11:17
which is basically going out and buying
11:19
a small business and taking it over and
11:20
running it and so I got together with a
11:22
friend of mine I kind of sold him on
11:23
this Vision we had been talking about
11:24
doing a project together for a couple
11:26
years he's like yeah I'll come along
11:27
let's do it so we got the money together
11:29
to put uh to kind of go in and start
11:31
looking for a company we went through
11:33
and talked to at least 50 to 100
11:35
Founders about their business how big it
11:37
was what might make sense for them to if
11:39
they wanted to exit uh and then we found
11:41
three or four that looked really good we
11:43
finally settled on one that that we
11:45
really liked and the founder was ready
11:46
to go what it showed me was a it's
11:47
possible to buy another business uh B
11:50
now that we've run it for a few months
11:51
it's possible to run someone else's
11:52
business uh and it lets you skip years
11:55
of work and I I mean I don't want to say
11:56
that's free because we obviously we paid
11:58
for for it right and there's a lot of
12:00
debt that's on the table but at the same
12:02
time like we've now jumpstarted our
12:04
second company our goal was to you know
12:06
learn how this process works we're
12:07
buying a company prove that we can do it
12:09
and we can run it we can make it better
12:11
hopefully over time and then hopefully
12:13
do it again in a couple years let's talk
12:14
about the opportunity of productized
12:16
services they're kind of blowing up
12:17
right now why do you think this is and
12:19
why are you so bullish on them
12:20
productize services are super appealing
12:22
they were for me because they'll allow
12:24
you to start a business that is
12:27
theoretically scalable but at the same
12:28
same time takes very little cost to get
12:30
started with so I think they're a great
12:32
place to start for a lot of
12:33
entrepreneurs they're kind of a little
12:34
bit of The Best of Both Worlds of like a
12:36
traditional agency or Consulting model
12:38
mixed with SAS and that you know
12:39
reoccurring Revenue if someone's
12:41
starting a productize service today what
12:42
do you think are some of the best niches
12:44
or Industries or verticals to go after I
12:46
would kind of look at the way I started
12:47
draft. deev what's something you're
12:49
interested in and have the skills to
12:51
maybe do on your own at the beginning
12:53
especially if you're a first-time
12:53
entrepreneur because I'll admit that you
12:55
shouldn't be doing all the work forever
12:57
but hiring other people is a a whole
12:59
skill that you have to learn over time
13:01
and you should kind of grow into it baby
13:02
steps so if you're starting your first
13:04
product di service find something that
13:06
you could do most of the work with
13:07
yourself if you had to and then that
13:09
there is actual market demand and this
13:11
again goes back to my number one advice
13:13
for new entrepreneurs is talk to more
13:15
potential customers and learn what are
13:17
they paying for today that they're
13:18
unsatisfied with and if you can get that
13:20
answer out of your target audience an
13:22
audience you want to work with that's
13:23
how you build a producti service I think
13:25
the wrong approach is go I want to do a
13:28
producti design agency cuz I've seen
13:29
other ones be successful but I don't
13:31
know anybody who would buy from me and I
13:32
don't know anybody who needs it and I
13:33
don't know why those other ones are
13:35
successful I just know they are on the
13:36
other hand if you're able to go talk to
13:37
10 or 12 customers that have tried these
13:39
other agencies have been unsatisfied why
13:41
are they unsatisfied what did what could
13:43
you do better if you redesign the
13:44
service from the ground up and that's
13:46
going to give you a way to differentiate
13:48
and that's the name of the game when it
13:49
comes to like carving your own little
13:51
niche in any product service all right
13:53
man thank you for having me this been
13:55
amazing congrats on all your success man
13:57
thank you follow this advice and you'll
13:59

Title: They Built A $2M Business To Fund Their Dreams
Show: Starter Story
Host: Pat Walls
Aired: Oct 18, 2023
In this video, I'm in Chicago to meet Dylan and Henry - two college roommates who built a $2M/Year business to fund their creative dreams. They share their strategies for landing BIG clients (Ali Abdaal, Will Smith, Naval...), AND the secret that has gotten them over 1 billion views on YouTube. But the best part about their business - they optimize for fun first... THEN for money.
Transcript:
Intro
0:00
these two roommates built a $1.8 million
0:02
year business in 2 years they've worked
0:05
with some of the biggest names on the
0:06
internet and have done over 1 billion
0:08
views on YouTube with a simple formula
0:10
for going viral but they have a
0:13
confession their business is not
0:15
profitable we had like $40,000 of just
0:18
debt for like months and months and
0:20
months they choose not to be profitable
0:22
for a reason because their goal is to
0:24
build a business that optimizes for
0:26
having fun rather than profits and like
0:28
Mr Beast in invest every dollar back
0:31
into creating their own content and
0:33
chasing their dreams make as much cash
0:35
here and then dump that all into
0:37
building the next Disney they invited me
0:39
into their wacky studio in Chicago broke
0:41
down all the ways they make money and
0:43
showed me just how fun it is to build a
0:45
business with your best friend they also
0:47
broke down their dead simple formula on
0:49
how they can guarantee millions of views
0:52
just humans are
0:54
wired in this video Henry and Dylan put
0:57
on a master class on how to chase your
0:59
dreams while having a ton of fun
1:01
along the way I'm Pat walls and this is
Meet The Boys
1:04
starter story welcome thanks for having
1:07
me tell me about who you guys are and
1:09
what you built I'm Henry this is oh my
1:11
best bud Dylan and uh we built clip. Co
1:14
which is an animation studio that does 2
1:16
million bucks a year in Topline and then
1:19
we take basically all the profits from
1:21
that and we make these crazy animated
1:23
shorts of our own to tell you know
1:25
really complicated ideas in a simple
Business Breakdown
1:27
funny way can you guys explain to me how
1:29
your business works works and what your
1:31
goal is by creating this business to
1:33
fund your creative Pursuits so basically
1:35
we've got pool of the best animators in
1:38
the world best animators and video
1:39
editors and then we work with a lot of
1:41
companies that have a lot of media that
1:43
they want to make but they don't have
1:45
anyone to execute on it so we just match
1:46
up awesome animator with company that
1:49
doesn't have any editors and we
1:50
basically let them work together so that
1:52
business clip. Co is this cash flowing
1:54
machine that allows us to hire you know
1:57
we have like 10 of our own animators
1:59
that just work on our content and pay us
2:01
so it cash flows into the content that
2:03
we want to make and how much content are
Content Strategy
2:05
you guys making our goal with content is
2:07
like can we just get out one short per
2:09
day now I say that but they're like one
2:11
of the most highly animated 60c shorts
2:14
in the world we say it's like South Park
2:16
for nerds so we want to explain
2:18
something in 60 seconds that may be
2:19
really complex but tell it in a funny
2:21
and simple way and we're also taking
2:23
those shorts and turning them into an
2:25
illustrated email so basically double
2:27
the content and what kind of numbers are
1 Billion Views
2:29
this this content that doing in the last
2:30
year of putting out daily shorts we've
2:32
done a billion views combined and then
2:34
we just launched this smart nonsense
2:36
newsletter which did like 10,000 Subs in
2:38
the first month and now we're 3 weeks
2:40
later and we're at like 20,000 Subs take
2:42
me through the timeline of when you guys
Background
2:44
first met and everything you've built
2:45
since I met Henry at this accepted
2:48
student day in college in 2015 we're
2:50
basically good friends through all of
2:52
college the only like entrepreneurial
2:54
friends we kept talking and by 2020
2:56
we're like hey let's take these
2:57
conversations and turn them into a
2:59
podcast
3:00
and hopefully the whole world will
3:01
listen he's like dude like I think if we
3:04
start a podcast and it'll be about this
3:06
we'll call it smart nonsense and dude
3:08
based on my numbers in 6 months we could
3:09
have a million people listening to this
3:11
thing and I'm like sign me up 3 months
3:14
later we're running out of like
3:15
unemployment money from the government
3:17
and the podcast has 14 views um and so
3:20
that's when we were like okay we need to
3:22
figure out how to make money service
3:23
business was the best way to do that we
3:25
didn't really have anything it was just
3:26
us we had some ideas we turned that into
3:28
an agency which prints a lot of money
3:30
and then we have all these animators and
3:33
all this money and we're like 2022 is
3:34
the year of making content so for the
3:36
last year we've been making YouTube
3:38
shorts and that's what's taken us from
3:40
zero to a million Subs on YouTube and a
3:42
billion views where did the idea for
Finding The Idea (Blitz Strategy)
3:44
clip the agency come from it was
3:46
basically like we made a podcast and
3:48
hired editors abroad in the Philippines
3:50
to help us produce it we like did this
3:52
whole system so I'm like let's try this
3:54
little podcast system with our favorite
3:56
podcast which the first one was my first
3:59
million they're looking to crack into
4:00
video Sam par and Sean Puri have no idea
4:04
how to do a video podcast so they're
4:05
hitting up Twitter like yo who's going
4:07
to help us with video should we do video
4:09
vote in this poll or whatever and we're
4:11
like dude we'll do it for free and we're
4:12
there tomorrow yeah and basically like
4:15
forged plane tickets we're like dude
4:17
we're we're literally there tomorrow I
4:18
hope you're at your house and then Sam
4:19
and like are you you guys serious like
4:22
what the what is this so we had
4:23
this strategy like we're crazy we're
4:24
going to show you exactly what we're
4:25
going to do for you and then just beat
4:28
you over the head with it until you pay
4:29
us money we tried this with the all-in
4:31
podcast we want to work with them so
4:32
like let's make one video for them
4:34
that'll like wake them up second video
4:36
is like oh this is really interesting
4:37
like what's Henry doing what's Dylan
4:39
doing and the third video they're like
4:41
how do we work with you and it was cool
4:42
like in allin's case I remember the
4:44
first Blitz video went out and Jason
4:47
kakanis was like I don't know what you
4:49
want but like you're hired so that it
4:52
woke him up pissed him
4:54
off one so you guys were basically just
How They Self-Funded The Business
4:57
doing free work how did you guys fund
4:59
this the first agency we worked with
5:01
basically gave us a little bit of buffer
5:03
we have maybe a month of free work we
5:05
can do but they better pay us like the
5:07
day that month ends Unfortunately they
5:09
didn't pay us the day ended so Henry's
5:11
credit card basically came into our
5:14
lives and we had like $40,000 of just
5:17
debt for like months and months and
5:19
months and we were always of the mindset
5:20
we were like okay if we can't pay this
5:22
credit card what's the worst it's a 20%
5:25
premium we got to like we just have to
5:26
make 20% more money that was kind of our
5:28
mindset just have to sell one more
5:30
client we can do that luckily we tend to
5:32
grow the business to like pay it off but
5:33
it is this risky like scary in the
5:35
moment oh we do have a lot of debt
5:36
like a lot writing on this you guys have
Landing Big Clients (Squatter Marketing)
5:38
worked with some huge names Will Smith
5:40
Ali abdal nval how did you land huge
5:43
clients like that we called it squatter
5:44
marketing we're just going to pretend
5:46
like they hired us and be the crazy
5:48
person that like makes videos for them
5:50
for a year straight just not getting
5:52
paid but because they share all our
5:53
stuff everyone thinks we work with them
5:55
they're like oh if Allen wants to work
5:57
with them why wouldn't we cuz that's the
5:59
PIN
6:00
so now we get all the clients from their
6:02
Network quick break this is me 5 years
6:05
ago desperate to start my own business
6:07
but plagued with shiny object syndrome I
6:09
tried building SAS tools freelancing
6:11
affiliate marketing but none of these
6:13
business ideas ever panned out to
6:15
anything but everything changed one day
6:16
when I looked inside and wondered what
6:18
if instead I built a business around
6:20
what I'm good at and what I'm passionate
6:23
about well that decision led me to
6:25
building a business that now makes over
6:27
a million dollar a year and that's what
6:29
starter stories all about it's a
6:31
community of thousands of Founders who
6:33
changed their life by building an online
6:35
business around their skills and their
6:37
passions our 4,000 plus case studies and
6:40
business idea breakdowns will show you
6:41
how regular people just like you found
6:44
the right idea and turned it into
6:45
millions for example Luke join starter
6:48
story and Dove or a case study about a
6:50
newsletter business that makes over $25
6:52
million a year just one month later he
6:54
launched his own newsletter business
6:55
that did $5,800 in Revenue in 30 days so
6:59
so if you're serious about finding that
7:00
right idea click the first link in the
7:02
description we're running a special for
7:04
the YouTube family all right enjoy the
7:06
video I'll see you around peace you guys
How To Create Viral Content
7:08
have done over a billion views on
7:09
YouTube You've created viral content to
7:12
a science so what's the secret of
7:14
creating viral content how do you do it
7:15
when we were trying to engineer viral
7:17
content Dylan comes to me and he's like
7:19
what have people been watching forever
7:21
for the last tens of thousands of years
7:23
and what will they keep watching and we
7:24
came to the conclusion it was like story
7:26
people were telling stories in cave
7:27
paintings so they will be around another
7:30
50,000 years right we were doing all
7:32
this content before that was like
7:34
abstract and I was talking about book
7:36
quotes and like who knows what and Dylan
7:38
was like Henry just tell a really good
7:40
story humans are wired to listen to
7:42
stories so if your story is good on a
7:44
60-second clip you can get people to
7:46
watch for 55 seconds the human brain
7:48
literally can't not finish watching a
7:50
story like we want to close those Loops
7:52
so that was the big breakthrough with
7:54
story and then our advantage was we had
7:56
this team of amazing animators so we
7:59
could can now animate these stories and
8:01
bring them to life with basically our
8:03
version of South Park so now you're
8:05
hooked on the story itself and then
8:07
you're just following the journey on
8:08
screen you guys have a team of 50
How To Hire
8:11
animators and editors tell me about how
8:13
to hire great people and keep them on
8:15
our principle has always been hire
8:17
better so our current team we're not
8:20
going to accept them unless they wow you
8:22
meaning like wow this person is better
8:24
than me I would learn from them and then
8:26
you look back and you have 50 people who
8:28
are all just learning from each other
8:30
and it's so Talent dense when we're
8:32
looking at people's portfolios we should
8:34
just trust our gut if they're really
8:35
good our gut is always like whoo like
8:38
did our did our jaw Hit the Floor were
8:40
we like wow if we see someone work and
8:42
our guts like on the fence never going
8:44
to work out and where do you find this
Where To Find Talented Editors
8:45
kind of talent we started hiring when we
8:47
were getting money from the government
8:49
to survive and we're like okay Henry
8:51
will sleep on the floor so he doesn't
8:52
need as much money and I just wear the
8:54
same t-shirts every day so we'll take
8:57
the extra money and hire editors but we
8:59
we couldn't afford like A5 $6,000 editor
9:02
in the us but we knew we also couldn't
9:04
afford to be editing content daily if we
9:06
wanted to make content daily we need to
9:08
Outsource the editing immediately yeah
9:11
or otherwise we'll burn out we can't
9:12
edit and make all the content if we want
9:13
to focus on the content we need an
9:15
editor immediately so we hired in the
9:17
Philippines the Philippines is the best
9:19
place in the world for Creative Talent
9:21
what is the cost of something like that
Costs of The Team
9:23
look like a
9:24
lot the cost is a lot so our personal
9:27
teams like maybe 25 or 30 grand a month
9:30
which is funny because that's a lot of
9:33
money to be paying for shorts that make
9:35
5 grand a month so operating at a total
9:38
loss but for us it's like that never
9:40
felt like much money because it was just
9:43
cash flowing from the agency we never
9:44
saw it it was never in our pockets like
9:46
might as well be I don't know lit on
9:48
fire maybe this is the benefit of doing
9:50
the Mr B strategy of just throwing
9:52
profits back into everything so it
9:53
doesn't feel like we're spending
9:55
anything for anyone watching this video
Starting A Business With A Friend
9:57
I want to know what it's like to start a
9:58
business with your best friend I don't
10:01
know how you could start a business
10:02
without your best friend at this point
10:05
the highs are so incredibly High and the
10:07
lows are so Grim I guess one thing we do
10:09
is just like use humor to get out of it
10:11
every time it's like lucky we going to
10:12
make 50 Grand by tomorrow how do we do
10:15
that and he's like dude I don't know but
10:17
we do it every time for any solo founder
10:19
uh kudos to you but we could never do it
10:21
this is like the best thing in the world
10:23
I'll also add like so Dylan's a
10:25
perfectionist through and through sweats
10:27
the details every single one of
10:29
um and my skill set is very much like
10:32
let me just ship things that are 80%
10:33
good enough so me without a Dylan over
10:37
time just like starts sprinting in the
10:39
wrong direction Dylan without me doesn't
10:41
get enough stuff shipped out the door to
10:43
have iterations so I think are that kind
10:45
of co-founder of maybe the executor and
10:48
maybe the perfectionist or the Visionary
10:51
um or the Builder and the seller I do
10:53
think like that's probably the maybe the
10:55
best archetype but maybe it's all I know
10:57
so you guys have this business that
Content OVER Money
10:59
makes $2 million but your whole focus is
11:02
on creating content why content over
11:05
money well we saw the The Pinnacles of
11:07
success luckily like doing all this
11:09
blitzing we got into the room into
11:11
literal parties with some of the richest
11:13
most powerful people and the funny thing
11:14
was a lot of them were jealous of us and
11:17
what we could do so they would ask us
11:19
about like Hey how do you how do you
11:20
build a personal brand like how do you
11:21
grow and uh we're just like let's just
11:23
make enough money we don't need a
11:25
billion dollars like they do and just
11:26
funnel all our money into content and
11:28
just kind like shortcut what they did
Day in the life
11:30
walk me through a day in the life for
11:31
you guys you got two really sides of the
11:33
business that you're working on what
11:35
does a typical day look like for you
11:36
with these businesses at this point
11:38
because we've outsourced the entire
11:39
running of the agency it's just like
11:41
explore ask the question why find that
11:44
thread go down the rabbit hole and then
11:46
our job is just like tell it in a
11:48
60-second book report which is super fun
11:50
so we just get to learn and be curious
11:52
and then I spend maybe an hour a day
11:54
just like floating around the agency
11:56
making sure there's no major fires and
11:58
then we usually talk in the afternoon
12:00
and he's got some crazy ideas something
12:02
he's been uh thinking about that we
12:04
explore what is the long-term Vision
Future Vision & Strategy
12:06
what does the future look like for what
12:07
you guys are doing we're definitely
12:08
lifestyle first so we're just like
12:10
always optimizing for fun what's the
12:12
path of least resistance how can we have
12:13
the fewest headaches like how can we
12:15
just be happiest in the short run so it
12:17
was always like how can we put the right
12:18
people in place to make sure we're
12:19
working on the content on the stuff one
12:22
thing we like is this idea of being
12:23
above the clouds it came from Colin and
12:25
smeir but it's like you need to stay
12:27
above the clouds have everyone doing
12:28
what whatever they need to be doing
12:29
below the clouds but the second you the
12:31
the leaders or the Explorers The
12:32
Visionaries the second you come below
12:34
the clouds and you're like doing
12:35
day-to-day stuff and like answering this
12:37
and doing that fire you're in a lot of
12:38
trouble beyond that we don't we don't
12:40
plan too far out I have this tendency of
12:42
planning and planning and planning and
12:44
getting the logo design and doing the
12:45
artwork and like not actually doing
12:47
anything so Dylan having us just like
12:49
default to action our plan is in the
12:51
short run optimize for happiness and
12:53
then like as a byproduct just teach as
12:55
many people as possible seems to be
12:57
working where can people watching this
How To Find Profitable Ideas
12:59
YouTube video get ideas on how to make
13:01
money now we started with our own itch
13:04
we needed a podcast to get edited so we
13:06
hired editors and then oh turns out
13:09
other people have podcasts that they
13:10
need edited so they just used our
13:12
editors turns out they could pay us for
13:14
that so we have always just subscribed
13:16
to do what you want create the product
13:17
you want and there are probably other
13:19
people like you so sell them that
13:20
product yeah if we create something we
13:22
truly need right now there's probably 10
13:24
other people that need it and we can
13:25
charge them a couple thousand bucks
13:26
that's enough money to live so
13:28
scratching your own itch last question
Advice
13:30
we asked the founders if you could go on
13:32
your guys' shoulders and give each other
13:35
advice what would you do differently or
13:36
what advice would you have for Founders
13:38
the tendency because it was my tendency
13:40
is to just over complicate almost
13:43
everything in business I'm like thinking
13:45
about oh what's our subscription price
13:47
and ah turn's too high and like we need
13:49
account managers and we need project
13:51
managers and we need quality assurance
13:52
and dyan's like no if we can match an
13:54
animator with a client for 2 years
13:57
everything else goes to zero nothing
13:58
else matter matters I think a big
14:00
misconception is how you approach
14:02
business business shouldn't be this you
14:04
make money 10 years in the future which
14:05
is kind of where Henry was going
14:07
originally versus I'm like how do I make
14:08
money 10 hours in the future how do I do
14:10
something now make money today I think
14:12
people just get scared about business
14:14
and end up not doing anything when you
14:15
could just go and Pitch your idea and
14:18
try and make 10 bucks off it that's the
14:20
advice I would give to anyone thinking
14:21
about becoming an entrepreneur thanks
14:22
for having me guys thanks for coming
14:25
through follow this advice and you'll
14:27

Transcript:
0:00
this is Alex a guy who started a
0:02
newsletter in his dorm room and then
0:04
sold it for Millions but after selling
0:07
that business he felt lost and spent
0:09
months trying to figure out what idea he
0:12
would pursue next it basically took me
0:14
12 months of doing every cliche thing
0:17
that an entrepreneur does when they're
0:19
looking for meaning this year he found a
0:21
new opportunity a new identity to become
0:24
a multipreneur the goal to launch a
0:27
bunch of different tiny businesses and
0:29
then CEOs to run them over the next 5 to
0:32
10 years I want to have a dozen plus
0:34
companies that sit under me that I am
0:36
the CEO of none of but I am the
0:39
co-founder and chairman of all of them I
0:41
flew out to New York to ask him about
0:42
this personal holding company and how it
0:44
all works turns out he's already
0:46
launched a few ideas and one of them is
0:48
already a million-dollar business so we
0:51
have uh 12 clients that are paying
0:53
$7,000 a month it's roughly a million a
0:57
year in annualized Revenue we're going
0:58
to dive more into that business business
1:00
and go over his framework for how he
1:02
finds new business ideas worth pursuing
1:05
the best way to think of business ideas
1:06
is
1:08
to plus we'll cover the insanely Scrappy
1:11
method he used to launch that million--
1:13
dooll business how he defines product
1:14
Market fit and how to hire top tier CEOs
1:18
to run these businesses I'm Pat walls
1:21
and this is starter
1:22
[Music]
1:23
story what's up man what's up yeah
1:26
thanks for having me okay tell me who
1:27
you are and what are you building uh I'm
1:29
Al liberman I started a company in
1:31
college called morning Brew uh which
1:33
makes Business Media fun and engaging
1:36
for modern professionals morning Brew is
1:38
a 200 person company that does more than
1:40
$75 million a year in revenue and today
1:43
I'm building story ARB a uh modern
1:45
Executives personal Media company and my
1:48
goal ultimately is to have a portfolio
1:49
of bootstrap businesses under me so what
1:52
does that mean a portfolio of bootstrap
1:53
businesses there's this idea of personal
1:56
holding companies that's been talked a
1:57
lot about recently some people call them
2:00
personal Venture Studios or my buddy
2:02
Greg Eisenberg uh coined the term
2:04
multipreneur a personal holding company
2:06
very simply is a company that is
2:08
comprised of companies under it uh and
2:11
so the idea would be let's just say Alex
2:13
lieberman's company is Alex liberman LLC
2:17
there would be hypothetically 10
2:18
businesses that sit under Alex liberman
2:20
LLC and I'm the CEO of the holding
2:23
company my vision for my own personal
2:25
holding company is over the next 5 to 10
2:29
years want to have a dozen plus
2:31
companies that sit under me that I am
2:33
the CEO of none of but I am the
2:35
co-founder and chairman of all of them
2:37
and for me I get excited by that because
2:39
it allows me to spend my time on the
2:41
things within entrepreneurship that I
2:43
most excited by that morning Brew taught
2:45
me over the last 8 to 10 years today uh
2:48
we have you know one company within my
2:50
personal hold code which is story ARB
2:52
and story ARB is a ghost rating Agency
2:55
for B2B Executives um and very simply we
2:59
help the top 1% of Founders or
3:02
Executives build their brands on Twitter
3:05
and Linkedin I put0 into it and our goal
3:08
is to get to product Market fit as
3:10
quickly as possible with the ultimate
3:11
goal of having story RB a $10 million
3:14
business on its own and profiting at
3:16
least 3.5 million every year can you
3:18
give us a timeline of how you get here I
3:21
dreamed of only one thing when I was
3:23
growing up and that was working on Wall
3:25
Street I went to college at the
3:26
University of Michigan from 2011 to 2015
3:29
studied business they are still on this
3:31
path to have the world's greatest Trader
3:33
job ever while I was at Michigan week
3:36
before my junior year my dad passed away
3:38
suddenly he was 46 years old died of a
3:41
stroke was in perfect health like me and
3:44
so that feeling of obligation basically
3:48
guided the next 8 years of my life it
3:50
forced this perspective on me that every
3:53
day could be our last and we really
3:55
should spend our time in a way that
3:57
aligns with our values and fills us up
3:59
and so I graduate from Michigan I got
4:02
the world's greatest trading job I'm
4:04
working on Wall Street and I realize I'm
4:06
not fulfilled in the slightest while I
4:08
was doing that we had already started
4:10
morning brew and I was working on it on
4:12
the side and I realized I was so Fired
4:14
Up by what I was doing from 9:00 to
4:16
midnight far more fired up than what I
4:18
was doing from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 I quit
4:20
my job when we had 30,000 subscribers we
4:23
had not made a dollar on the business
4:25
but I just had this sense of um faith
4:28
and so did Austin that we'd be able to
4:29
figure out a way to make money as a
4:30
business so we sold the company in
4:32
October of 2020 to Axel Springer almost
4:35
6 months later I stepped down as CEO of
4:37
the business and that is probably the
4:39
hardest professional moment that I've
4:41
ever had 12 months of doing every cliche
4:44
thing that an entrepreneur does when
4:46
they're looking for meaning reading
4:48
about stoicism taking long walks with
4:51
their dog like I was trying to do
4:53
everything to figure out my purpose and
4:55
what I landed on was that there were a
4:58
few things that I love in business I
5:00
love spending time with other Founders I
5:02
love coaching them I love storytelling
5:05
and selling I love creating content and
5:07
I love spending my time on the early
5:09
days of the business you know what uh
5:11
Reed Hoffman calls the town and Village
5:13
stages versus like the city and state
5:16
stages I love that part of the business
5:18
and I just asked myself how can I spend
5:20
the rest of my career just in the town
5:22
and Village and not in the city and
5:24
state all right let's talk about why
5:25
personal holding companies are becoming
5:26
a thing what do you think is the
5:28
opportunity here why is it taking off
5:30
yeah so I think there's just a number of
5:32
different trends that we're seeing some
5:33
are like macro cultural and Global
5:36
Trends others our Trend specific to
5:39
entrepreneurship and the business
5:41
landscape the first which is like a
5:42
global trend is there's just increased
5:45
emphasis on the importance of like
5:48
lifestyle Balance and Health in a
5:51
professional's life and so I think it's
5:53
very much in Vogue now to be thinking
5:55
about how you're taking care of yourself
5:57
we're in a golden age of
5:58
Entrepreneurship right now because the
6:00
cost of failure of Entrepreneurship has
6:02
never been lower it is easier than ever
6:04
before to ideate or test ideas with
6:08
platforms like product hon or
6:09
Kickstarter it is easier or cheaper than
6:12
ever before to actually run your
6:13
business you have an e-commerce business
6:15
you Shopify you have a newsletter
6:16
business you you have beehive and so I
6:18
think it's inviting more people to start
6:21
businesses with this different image of
6:23
what a great business is and for a lot
6:24
of people that's a cash flowing asset
6:27
that maybe does six to seven figures a
6:29
year gives you a great lifestyle and
6:31
maybe you do that over and over and over
6:33
rather than trying to swing for the
6:35
fences with a$1 billion company that you
6:37
have .1% chance of actually succeeding
6:40
all right quick break this is me 5 years
6:42
ago desperate to start my own business
6:44
but plagued with shiny object syndrome I
6:46
tried building SAS tools freelancing
6:49
affiliate marketing but none of these
6:51
business ideas ever panned out to
6:53
anything but everything changed one day
6:54
when I looked inside and wondered what
6:56
if instead I built a business around
6:58
what I'm good at at and what I'm
7:00
passionate about well that decision led
7:03
me to building a business that now makes
7:04
over a million dollar a year and that's
7:07
what starter story is All About it's a
7:08
community of thousands of Founders who
7:10
changed their life by building an online
7:12
business around their skills and their
7:14
passions our 4,000 plus case studies and
7:17
business idea breakdowns will show you
7:19
how regular people just like you found
7:21
the right idea and turned it into
7:23
millions for example Luke join starter
7:25
story and do Andor case study about a
7:27
newsletter business that makes over $25
7:30
million a year just one month later he
7:32
launched his own newsletter business
7:33
that did $5,800 in Revenue in 30 days so
7:37
if you're serious about finding that
7:38
right idea click the first link in the
7:40
description we're running a special for
7:42
the YouTube family all right enjoy the
7:44
video I'll see you around peace with the
7:46
holding company your first big success
7:48
is a ghost writing agency can you tell
7:50
me how you started that yeah so you know
7:53
one day I was literally just on Twitter
7:56
I was thinking to myself how there's all
7:58
these short form video ages gencies that
8:00
I've seen like a dozen pop up in the
8:02
last 12 months I feel like text based
8:04
platforms like Twitter or X and Linkedin
8:07
haven't been given nearly enough love
8:09
and so I put out a tweet that basically
8:11
says if you're an executive who believes
8:14
in the power of building audience but
8:15
you don't have enough time or you don't
8:17
have the skill to do it yourself and
8:19
you're willing to spend $5 to $10,000 a
8:21
year to have someone else help you build
8:23
it DM me so I got 25 DMs like that's my
8:26
favorite way to build a business is like
8:28
product doesn't exist yet you get a
8:30
sense of demand then you build the
8:31
product after you truly build the plane
8:33
as you're flying it so I was like okay
8:35
there's demand now my next issue I need
8:37
to solve for is Supply I need ghost
8:39
riters CU I'm not going to write all
8:40
these things so I literally connected
8:43
clients with two of the ghost writers
8:45
set up a slack channel for them two or 3
8:47
months in I was like okay there's enough
8:50
legitimacy here where now I think I can
8:51
advertise where the business is to hire
8:53
a great CEO cuz again with the person
8:55
personal holding company model I did not
8:58
want to be the CEO of this business
8:59
business and the idea is hopefully we
9:01
get to product Market fit with the
9:02
company by end of year where ultimately
9:04
I only spend 5 to 10 hours a week on the
9:06
business and that is kind of the time or
9:08
investment trajectory that I hope to
9:10
have with any business that I spin up
9:12
can you break down story ARB how's it
9:15
set up and how's it doing yep so we have
9:18
uh 12 clients uh that are paying
9:21
$7,000 um a month so $84,000 Top Line a
9:25
month it's roughly a million a year in
9:27
annualized Revenue we think this
9:29
business can be a $10 million a year
9:31
business that's basically 110 clients we
9:34
have two full-time employees uh our CEO
9:38
as well as content strategist who's a
9:40
hybrid of account manager and kind of
9:42
content mind and then we have three
9:45
Freelancers who are ghost riders the
9:47
profit margin on this type of business
9:48
is roughly 30 to 35% so you know the
9:52
goal ultimately is a $10 million
9:54
business that does $3 to $3.5 million a
9:57
year in cash flow and basically
9:59
basically for our clients uh we
10:01
interview them once a month we get all
10:03
the thoughts out of their head and we
10:04
have our ghost writer and content
10:05
strategist create 12 pieces of content
10:07
per week per client you mentioned
10:09
product Market fit how do you determine
10:12
that and how do you know when you've
10:12
reached product Market fit it depends on
10:14
the business that you're in for story
10:17
ARB I think of product Market fit in two
10:20
ways one as a percentage of of our
10:23
current clients what percentage of our
10:25
clients would recommend story ARB to the
10:28
people in their Network where their
10:30
reputation is on the line and I want
10:32
that number to be at least 50% okay the
10:35
other number that I'm focused on is
10:36
retention because again I think the
10:39
easiest part of this business is getting
10:40
customers I think the hardest part of
10:42
this business is keeping customers and
10:44
I've heard historically for ghost riding
10:46
agencies that when I talk to people who
10:48
own ghost riding agencies they retain
10:50
their average customer for like 3 to 5
10:52
months that is like a scary short period
10:55
of time and so our goal is when we hit
10:58
true product Market fit our average
11:00
customer will have worked with us for on
11:03
average 10 months and so those are the
11:05
metrics we're focused on to hit that
11:07
point where we feel like we can now
11:09
scale our customer base now because
11:10
clearly we're providing something that's
11:12
super valuable to people a CEO runs each
11:16
of the companies within your personal
11:17
holding company how do you find great
11:19
CEOs basically I look for a few
11:22
qualities that I consider to be the
11:23
unteachables I look for someone who has
11:25
an obsessive brain I want someone who
11:28
goes to sleep than you about the
11:29
business and I want someone waking up
11:30
thinking about the business cuz it means
11:31
they enjoy what they're doing so much I
11:34
want someone who's a great critical
11:35
thinker I want them to think about how
11:37
are they informed by their previous
11:38
experiences but also how is this
11:40
situation different and how do they need
11:42
to behave differently I want someone
11:44
whose value align with me like I want
11:45
someone who's high integrity strong
11:48
Communicator like the things that really
11:50
matter no matter what business you're
11:52
working in and the final piece is a
11:54
great work ethic every day of the week
11:56
i' bet on someone who is less talented
11:59
but has more humility and self-awareness
12:01
because I believe if they also have good
12:03
work ethic like they will just grit
12:05
their way to a higher ceiling and they
12:07
will also always be willing and have the
12:10
humility to call out their blind spots
12:12
but I really think it's almost
12:13
impossible to teach good work ethic and
12:15
so I need that in CEO that I bring on
12:18
how do you pay CEOs and how the
12:20
distributions look like basically the
12:22
range is a CEO a salary between $100 to
12:26
$200,000 a year and then there equity in
12:29
the business will be somewhere between
12:30
10 and 50% whenever one of my businesses
12:33
hits product Market fit every quarter
12:36
thereafter all of the profits of the
12:38
business are distributed to equity
12:39
holders and the CEO will get their
12:41
percentage of equity in profit
12:43
distribution and the whole idea is by
12:45
having this distribution strategy it
12:48
keeps the CEO super incentivized to
12:50
continue to grow the business all right
12:52
so you got this one successful business
12:55
now you're thinking of new ideas can you
12:56
tell me how you approach new ideas and
12:59
how do you validate them first of all
13:01
the the best way to think of business
13:03
ideas is to never just sit on a couch
13:06
thinking of business ideas that is the
13:07
worst way to do it right be a magnet for
13:10
problems so be incredible at finding and
13:12
hoarding people's problems and then
13:14
thinking about what are novel solutions
13:15
for solving those problems if I wanted
13:17
to launch another business today I would
13:20
but I want to focus with story AR first
13:21
so if anyone wants to steal one of these
13:23
ideas they can the first idea is what I
13:25
call workflow automation agency I think
13:28
the next big one will be basically like
13:30
notion or air table or different forms
13:33
of automation agencies using these no
13:36
code tools like zapier and make as well
13:39
as using Ai and offshore talent and I
13:42
think every business you will end up
13:43
finding people working on manual tasks
13:45
that can be automated or outsourced so
13:47
if I was to build my next business in
13:49
the holdco it would be that I think
13:50
there's so much opportunity to build it
13:52
so your audience should feel free to
13:53
steal the idea and take it and build it
13:54
themselves let's talk about the risks of
13:56
a personal holding company they're
13:58
pretty sexy right now blowing up but
14:00
what do you think could be the downfall
14:02
of that personal holding companies work
14:03
well for people who understand what a
14:06
personal holding company offers you and
14:08
it aligns with what you want to spend
14:09
your time on that's why I'm doing it but
14:11
the first big risk is dilution it's lack
14:14
of focus like I want to get one business
14:16
right before thinking about my next
14:17
business so for story ARB right now we
14:19
don't have product Market fit in my mind
14:22
until we have product Market fit I'm not
14:23
going to launch another business once we
14:24
have product Market fit I will launch a
14:26
business and so my whole thesis on this
14:28
is go slow to be able to go fast so
14:30
launch a business figure out how to hit
14:32
product Market fit hopefully that makes
14:34
me better out launching a business and
14:36
hitting product Market fit faster the
14:38
next time and so each kind of iteration
14:40
of launching and finding success with a
14:42
business can happen faster and faster
14:44
but like I don't also have a number in
14:46
my head of like oh I need to be at 12
14:48
companies within the next 3 years I
14:50
would rather four successful businesses
14:52
than 12 non-successful businesses the
14:55
second when you have a personal holding
14:56
company and you're the entrepreneur
14:57
sitting at the top of it you have to
14:59
think of yourself as a product meaning
15:01
you are in service of the companies you
15:03
launch and the CEOs that you bring on
15:06
and so if your a products like any
15:08
products you have like value you have
15:10
value proposition you offer to your
15:12
companies and to your CEOs and if you
15:14
don't offer enough value two things
15:16
happen one you can't command nearly
15:20
enough equity to be excited about these
15:22
businesses that you've launched and two
15:25
Talent like employees aren't going to be
15:27
excited to work for your businesses
15:29
because they don't see the value that
15:30
you're bringing to the table yeah and so
15:32
those are the two huge risks and I spend
15:33
a ton of time thinking about them to
15:35
hopefully mitigate them so for anyone
15:36
watching this video uh and wants to
15:38
start a personal holding company what
15:40
would be a great business to start with
15:42
yeah I mean at the end of the day I
15:43
think it comes down to First
15:45
understanding your strengths and your
15:46
weaknesses you just need to be brutally
15:49
honest about what are the one or two
15:50
things you're exceptional at based on
15:52
your interest and your past called 5 to
15:54
10 years of work experience and build
15:56
around that first so one examp example I
15:58
would just use is like Greg Eisenberg
16:01
like Greg Eisenberg is the king of
16:03
community like he is known on Twitter
16:06
and on the internet as the guy who
16:08
understands how to build Vibrant
16:09
Community on the internet so what did he
16:11
do he went and launched a paid Community
16:14
for people building communities and
16:17
anyone who has interest in understanding
16:20
how to build a membership community on
16:22
the Internet is of course going to
16:24
follow Greg and join his community
16:27
because they know like he is the guy for
16:28
that plus not only is he just like great
16:30
from a marketing perspective because
16:32
people trust him for it he also knows
16:34
how to build great community so he can
16:35
constantly add value to his customers
16:38
within that membership all right so last
16:40
question we asked to all founders is if
16:42
you could stand on Alex's shoulder uh in
16:45
the early days and give him advice what
16:47
would you say a few things come to mind
16:49
first I like to say find the suck find
16:52
great problems to solve don't just sit
16:55
with friends on a weekend and brainstorm
16:57
business ideas like immerse yourself in
16:59
Industries you're interested in finding
17:01
problems in identify those problems
17:03
figure out what problems are especially
17:05
painful there isn't a good solution for
17:07
it and then start thinking about how can
17:08
you provide a better solution and the
17:10
second is everyone talks about taking
17:12
the leap of faith in entrepreneurship
17:14
and I just think it's completely a
17:15
misnomer it's more about like stepping
17:18
Pebble to Pebble carefully across the
17:20
river versus jumping over the river like
17:22
there are so many ways that you can test
17:24
ideas low cost on the internet today you
17:26
can put out ideas onto social you can
17:29
launch ideas on product hunt you can
17:31
launch a product on Kickstarter you can
17:33
create a Shopify store or you can create
17:36
a newsletter like my best idea for
17:39
launch or for testing anything is like I
17:41
always start with a tweet if there's
17:43
interest in a tweet I turn into a tweet
17:44
thread if there's interest in that I
17:46
turn into a newsletter if there's
17:47
interest in that and I turn into a video
17:49
the same exact concept exists for
17:50
business so don't think that business is
17:53
too risky for you because you have to
17:54
take a leap because business actually
17:56
can be very low risk if you step
17:59
intentionally step by step all right man
18:02
thank you thanks so much for having it
18:04
was awesome great to meet you yeah
18:06
follow this advice and you'll have a
18:08
seven figures ghost writing agency
18:09

Transcript:
0:00
this guy quit his $250,000 consulting
0:02
job with one goal to break free from
0:04
what he calls the default path aka the
0:08
rat race I sort of just like quit it was
0:11
the first time in my life that I just
0:13
let life emerge at 32 years old Paul
0:16
quit Corporate America to build a new
0:18
life but he had no plan so he did the
0:22
only thing he knew how to do he started
0:24
writing every day then he discovered
0:27
something that would change his life
0:28
forever he writes a book The pathless
0:32
Path is really my way of making sense of
0:35
my life after leaving the default path I
0:38
flew out to Austin Texas to meet Paul
0:40
and learn more about the pathless path
0:42
in this video we talk about how he found
0:44
his passion for writing why he chose to
0:46
self-publish his book and exactly how
0:49
much money he's made as a self-published
0:51
author last year I went from Grand in
0:54
revenue th000 and so far in the first 6
0:58
months of this year I'm on track to sort
1:00
beat that but more importantly we talk
1:02
about why everyone should consider
1:04
exploring the pathless path you can't
1:06
actually Escape work you ultimately need
1:08
to find work that can sustain your soul
1:11
and the pathless path is basically
1:13
committing to that I'm Pat walls and
1:15
this is starter story Paul I've been
1:18
reading all about your story and it's
1:20
amazing you went from a job that you
1:22
absolutely hated or wasn't for you and
1:25
now you've turned that into a very
1:27
successful self-published author tell me
Tell me more about you
1:29
more about you yeah so if you look at my
1:31
income it really flows up and down but
1:34
really this year is the first year that
1:36
book income has been half if not more of
1:39
my income in the first year I made about
1:41
$50,000 for my book I sold about 10,000
1:44
copies about $5 a book second year so
1:46
far the first five months I've sold
1:48
about 15,000 copies of my book and
1:51
that's been about $75,000 in royalty
1:54
which is pretty wild last year I went
1:56
from 100 Grand in Revenue that's Topline
1:59
that doesn't include costs or taxes to$
2:02
249,000 and so far in the first 6 months
2:05
of this year I'm on track to sort of
2:07
beat that though I probably won't
2:09
because I'm mostly choosing to just
2:11
spend more time with my daughter than
2:12
work or try to make money yeah but I
2:15
started writing while I was still
2:16
employed one morning I don't know why
2:19
about a year before I quit my job I just
2:20
decided to come into work and I said I'm
2:22
going to write on Kora every day before
2:25
I start doing my work and I did that for
2:27
like 100 days and something in that
2:29
clicked I think I was a writer from that
2:31
moment on but I was dealing with some
2:34
health issues I was dealing with Lyme
2:35
disease and a bunch of other stuff and I
2:37
just started a Blog called lime sucks
2:39
and I just started sending it to people
2:41
as I quit my job I started writing about
2:43
my path and it went from publishing
2:45
every 3 months to every two months to
2:47
every month to every week and now I'm
2:49
just writing all the time when you quit
2:50
your job when was that that was 2017
2:53
okay so tell me about that time you were
Tell me about that time
2:54
working a high salary job in New York
2:56
City tell me about that yeah so I
2:59
desperately want wanted to break into
3:01
fancy and prestigious companies early in
3:03
my career I wanted to feel special but
3:05
that never quite fulfills and so before
3:08
I quit my job I was still applying for
3:10
other jobs one company offered me much
3:13
less than my current salary and the
3:15
other ones rejected me and I sort of
3:17
just like quit it was like the first
3:20
time in my life that I just let life
3:22
emerge but the next few months were just
3:24
really hard I started taking action and
3:26
setting up my freelance firm and my
3:28
company in informed me that I had not
3:31
stayed 3 years and would have to pay
3:33
them back the $24,000 signing bonus and
3:36
relocation expenses it was like I had to
3:38
buy my freedom yeah but I had about I
3:41
think 50 60 Grand in savings and for me
3:44
that was like permission to just wander
3:47
and do nothing and even if I go to broke
3:49
I'll figure something out what I love
3:51
about your story is that you turn down a
3:54
very big deal with penguin random house
3:56
if you don't know they are one of the
3:58
biggest book publishers in the world so
Why did you selfpublish
4:00
you could go and self-publish tell me
4:02
why you did that yeah they reached out
4:04
and it was interesting because they do
4:06
have relationships that can help scale a
4:09
book to a wider audience but I think for
4:12
me it's too high of a price to pay one
4:14
creative control I'm not willing to pay
4:16
that price I don't want to give up any
4:18
creative control even if it means less
4:20
book sales for me and two they give you
4:23
10% of list price for hard covers which
4:25
would be about $2 for me paperbacks I
4:29
make about $7 $ a book hard covers I
4:31
make about $8 a book so it's highly
4:33
profitable when you got the idea for the
4:34
book tell me about the process of
The process of writing the book
4:36
writing it from a high level and then
4:38
also getting it into print and
4:40
publication early on I realized the
4:42
personal story felt like a powerful Edge
4:44
to explore so I just did that for a few
4:47
months and it felt so good to really
4:49
just say here's what I believe here's
4:51
what it matters and here's what it's all
4:53
about and here's my way of seeing the
4:55
world and then the whole process was
4:56
basically right intensely for a month or
4:59
two take a step back try to get the
5:01
structure and just go back and forth in
5:03
between those two modes then you just
5:04
output a PDF upload to Amazon and you
5:08
can start printing and sending out books
5:09
in like 3 days quick break this is me 5
5:12
years ago desperate to start my own
5:14
business but plagued with shiny object
5:16
syndrome I tried building SAS tools
5:18
freelancing affiliate marketing but none
5:21
of these business ideas ever panned out
5:23
to anything but everything changed one
5:24
day when I looked inside and wondered
5:26
what if instead I built a business
5:28
around what I'm good at and what I'm
5:30
passionate about well that decision led
5:33
me to building a business that now makes
5:35
over a million dollar a year and that's
5:37
what starter story is All About it's a
5:39
community of thousands of Founders who
5:41
changed their life by building an online
5:43
business around their skills and their
5:45
passions our 4,000 plus case studies and
5:47
business idea breakdowns will show you
5:49
how regular people just like you found

story and do Andor case study about a
5:58
newsletter business that makes over for
5:59
$25 million a year just 1 month later he
6:02
launched his own newsletter business
6:03
that did $5,800 in Revenue in 30 days so
6:07
if you're serious about finding that
6:08
right idea click the first link in the
6:10
description we're running a special for
6:12
the YouTube family all right enjoy the
6:14
video I'll see you around peace tell me
Why I wrote the book
6:16
about why you decided to write a book
6:18
about this and what's the what's the
6:20
theme behind the book The pathless Path
6:21
is really my way of making sense of my
6:25
life after leaving the default path the
6:27
thing about leaving the default path is
6:29
you realize how powerful of a story it
6:32
is for everyone people still ask what's
6:34
your plan how are you going to make
6:36
money after I left my job it felt weird
6:39
I didn't have a plan and I realized you
6:41
can't actually Escape work you
6:43
ultimately need to find work that can
6:46
sustain your soul I call this in my book
6:48
the real work of your life and the
6:50
pathless path is basically committing to
6:53
that without knowing when that will
6:55
arrive if you can monetize it and if you
6:58
can explain it to to your parents or
The pathless path
7:00
others how do you search for the work
7:02
and find the work that can be your
7:03
life's work if you're searching for the
7:05
work that matters you should remove
7:07
money from it as long as possible like
7:09
fight for that the key though is mostly
7:11
just quitting things if it's not the
7:13
thing lighting you up you need to get
7:15
that out of your life you need to
7:16
minimize it you need to automate it you
7:18
need to delegate it you need to quit
7:20
what I recommend to most people is to
7:22
try to find a 1 to three month Block in
7:24
adulthood to take a sabatical disconnect
7:26
from worker mode reconnect with
7:28
forgotten Hobbies because the only thing
7:30
that will let deeper things you can
7:31
commit to emerge is creating space in
7:34
your life I think too many people are
7:36
uninspired doing work that doesn't
7:38
matter them and they've made a deal to
7:40
keep doing it because well for the
7:42
paycheck for the health care benefits
7:44
I'm willing to light it all on fire go
7:46
broke decrease my earnings pay a status
7:49
tax to keep doing work that matters to
7:52
me once you find that work you're
7:55
willing to pay so much to have it
7:57
Central in your life all right let's
7:58
talk about self-publishing if I wanted
Selfpublishing
8:00
to self-publish my own book what do I
8:01
need to do if you really want to
8:03
basically do what I did which is I want
8:05
to create something that feels good
8:07
feels like a book matches what somebody
8:09
might expect from a traditional
8:11
publisher you want to invest in a good
8:14
editor somebody that can help you bring
8:15
the pieces together stick the landing
8:18
and how everything flows together and
8:20
that's typically called a developmental
8:22
editor that's probably going to be one
8:24
of your biggest Spence designing a book
8:25
cover I use 99 designs I picked a
8:28
designer I really liked his other
8:30
designs formatting you can either use
8:32
Amazon's tools to format the ebook or
8:35
you can use another tool called rezy
8:37
that's what I used I used the default
8:39
options and then at the end you might
8:41
want to hire somebody to proofread
8:42
here's the craziest thing though it asks
8:44
who's your publisher turns out you can
8:46
just write your name that's what I did
8:47
and tell me a little bit more about the
8:49
process of marketing a self-published
8:50
book my Approach is like what do I
8:52
actually like doing and I'll lean into
8:54
that I like talking on podcasts I like
8:56
talking about the ideas in the book
8:58
gifting book has been my other fun
9:00
Channel as well and it's super easy with
9:03
self-publishing too I can in the US send
9:05
them anywhere for 450 including shipping
9:08
what did the royalties look like what
9:09
are some of the numbers when I was
Royalty Numbers
9:11
looking at my royalty numbers I was
9:14
looking at
9:15
8.24 for hard cover through Amazon
9:18
$745 for paperback through Amazon $ 3.98
9:22
per audiobook
9:23
$428 per Kindle and then if I look at my
9:26
breakdown of sales it's about 50% ebook
9:30
29% print and 21% audio can you break
9:34
down the cost to create this book so
Cost Breakdown
9:37
editing and coaching is about $3,900
9:40
book cover cost me
9:41
$742 publishing was $250 a fee to Ingram
9:45
spark I now think that's free the Audi
9:47
book was
9:49
$1,280 to produce and as of today my
9:53
royalties it's basically profit is
9:55
anywhere from between 125,000 to 130,00
9:59
,000 so far all right Paul so as a
10:02
writer and a self-published author what
Monetization
10:04
are some other ways to monetize other
10:06
than just book sales for me it was
10:08
always make enough money to have the
10:09
space and time to continue to write
10:11
early on it was freelancing then it was
10:14
taking some of the experiences from
10:16
freelancing and turning that into a
10:18
course I have a whole another sort of
10:20
side thing I run called strategy U but
10:22
on top of that I slowly and deliberately
10:25
built a workshop business which was like
10:28
I'll do EX exactly this training for
10:30
this price teaching these things I've
10:33
always had this weird balance of like
10:35
strategy you and doing some coaching and
10:37
freelancing as needed but I keep that
10:39
minimal and writing and creating and
10:41
doing my podcast until recently the
10:44
writing and podcast and all those things
10:45
were not making any money it started to
10:48
even out do I have goals of becoming a
10:50
full-time Creator I don't know I kind of
10:52
like the weird mix all right Paul let's
Writing
10:54
talk about writing how to become a great
10:56
writer how to become a confident writer
10:58
like you basically just is Brute Force
10:59
you need to get in the Reps such that
11:02
you can deal with the fear the fear of
11:04
what will people say and then you'll
11:06
quickly realize especially when you're
11:07
starting is nobody says anything cuz you
11:10
don't have any readers and then I think
11:12
over the long term you really just need
11:14
to develop an individual relationship
11:16
with writing some people wake up and
11:18
write 4 hours every day that's never
11:20
been my style for me it's I need to
11:23
create space in my life and a big thing
11:25
I do is like I spend a lot of days
11:28
wandering because it's that wandering
11:31
mental time where I'm not really doing
11:33
anything I let ideas percolate I'm
11:35
usually reading a lot to I'm listening
11:37
to podcasts that's when the creativity
11:39
happens and the writing is only when I'm
11:42
channeling that later you've chosen this
11:44
pathless path tell me about what the
Typical Day
11:46
typical day in the life is for you
11:47
nowadays typical day in the life for me
11:50
is waking up and spending time with my
11:52
daughter she's a newborn now so she
11:54
requires a lot of attention and I'm
11:56
really just leaning into that the whole
11:57
point of my path has been to essentially
12:00
take time off whenever I want it does
12:02
that mean I'm not working most days no
12:04
I've typically worked a few hours most
12:07
days for the past several years but I've
12:10
always had the ability to just stop and
12:11
clear my calendar that's what I've done
12:13
for the past few months there's no
12:15
morning routine I typically never
12:17
schedule any sort of meeting before
12:19
11:00 a.m. I really just let whatever
12:21
flows flow if you could go back in time
12:24
when you're just starting out on your
12:25
pathless path and sit on Paul's shoulder
12:28
and tell him thing what would it be I
12:29
don't know if I'd mess with the
12:32
timeline but I might say something like
12:35
just
12:36
trust trust yourself I might say
12:39
something about writing too I might just
12:41
say like writing is important something
12:43
silly like that cuz you don't want to
12:45
give away the the fun of the journey the
12:47
journey has been so fun for me because
12:49
it's been so uncertain and that is
12:52
Adventure for me I don't know what's
12:53
going to come next even now I have no
12:55
idea what comes next I'm excited to see
12:57
what emerges that's the whole point of
12:59
this journey in this book and this path
13:01
all right you heard it here folks follow
13:03
the pathless path and you will be one of
13:04
the most successful authors in the world
13:07
like
13:14

this kid made over one million dollars
0:02
in one year with a business idea that
0:04
nobody's talking about AI generated
0:06
books he invited us into his apartment
0:08
in Toronto to show us where he found
0:10
this idea how he started on a budget and
0:12
how he built it in a few hours a day
0:14
while attending College full-time before
0:17
the money Joe popplus was just a uni
0:19
student stocking shelves for 11 bucks an
0:21
hour now he's making a living selling
0:23
thousands of ebooks using an
0:25
unconventional method with chat gbt
0:27
initially this wasn't the way I did it
0:29
but this is the best way to do it now
0:30
but the craziest part about his business
0:32
is actually not how he creates the books
0:34
it's how he advertises them the majority
0:37
of my money has been made off of dads
0:40
the AI Revolution is here and Joe is
0:42
living proof I'm Pat walls and this is
0:44
starter story
Joes Story
0:48
you built an amazing business tell me
0:50
about who you are and what you build I'm
0:52
Joe I'm a 20 year old computer science
0:54
student I've built a book brand that is
0:56
now valued at 930 000 I generate all
1:01
books with AI and then I Market them on
1:03
Pinterest to middle-aged moms how did
1:05
you come up with this business idea 2020
1:07
was the year when I graduated high
1:10
school I started working on a use case
1:12
for gpt3 I got a really good idea of how
1:15
AI could be integrated into different
1:16
business models in 2022 I was like why
1:19
don't I just utilize my pre-existing
1:22
skill sets AI gpt3 is now out a few
1:25
businesses know about it maybe I could
1:27
help provide some value to like some
1:29
small mid-sized businesses who want to
1:31
learn more about AI around that time
1:33
that I got that idea people actually
1:34
started reaching out to me asking about
1:36
my experience at openai I had a kind of
1:40
like tab on my LinkedIn that showed that
1:42
I had worked on use cases for openai for
1:44
the gpt3 beta they started asking me
1:46
certain things it got to the point point
1:48
where I started charging for the advice
1:51
that I was giving in July of 2022 I met
1:57
with the Publishing Company where I got
1:59
the idea they showed me their stats and
2:02
how much money they were making off of
2:03
selling books that was a complete
2:05
eye-opener for me I didn't realize how
2:08
many people bought books per month their
2:11
revenue was about two million dollars
2:12
which was absolutely insane to me I
2:15
thought why can't I just start up
2:17
something similar because what they were
2:19
doing was so insanely simple that they
2:22
were not doing anything AI book related
2:24
and when I met with them I told them
2:25
nothing about my idea that I had kind of
2:28
formulated while we were on the call in
2:30
the month of August I generated 10 20
2:33
books I generated a few more in
2:36
September by the end of September I was
2:37
at 40 bucks I generated 40 books with AI
2:39
then on October 3rd I hit my first
2:41
profitable day and I was like 20 October
2:44
4th I was like at forty dollars and then
2:46
from there it almost grew X-Men actually
2:48
on December 28th I'll never forget this
2:51
day that's when I hit my first 1K day
2:53
profit and that was crazy that was just
2:56
after Christmas and my whole family knew
2:58
about it I told all my friends we built
3:00
this business from money that you made
3:01
for your minimum wage job did you do it
3:03
all yourself yeah it was completely
3:05
self-funded and if I did it properly the
3:07
first time with the stuff that I know
3:09
now I could have started it up in under
3:11
500 but I just made a bunch of mistakes
3:13
yeah it's just a new Venture for me how
3:15
did you manage building this business
3:16
while you're in school and you had a
3:19
part-time job that was probably the
3:20
hardest part for me I was fitting in
3:22
time for me to work on the book brand
3:24
when I was studying for a huge test it
3:28
was coming up in school I dropped two
3:30
courses to work on my book Brands but I
3:33
spent most of the day working on school
3:35
and then I would spend five six hours in
3:38
the nights working on my book print how
How To Get Into AI
3:40
can someone who's watching right now get
3:41
into AI generative books the best way to
3:45
start off learning is taking an interest
3:47
in these gender of AI models and
3:49
learning how they work how you can get
3:51
the best output out of them with the
3:53
correct settings with the correct
3:54
prompts then you need to find a niche a
3:58
niche that has traffic a niche that has
4:00
a lot of ambitious people in it when you
4:02
have people like that you can tug on
4:05
their emotions more and you can present
4:08
the outcome to them that they want to
4:10
achieve and the only way to get to that
4:12
outcome is through your product your
4:15
first AI ebook that you created tell me
4:16
about how you did it I literally knew
4:19
nothing about books so I was researching
4:21
how to actually build a book I knew I
4:23
could write it with AI like I knew the
4:24
output would be good enough but I had no
4:26
knowledge on how I should structure it
4:28
what should be included all of that when
4:30
I created my first book it was probably
4:32
the worst book anybody could ever read
4:34
like there was no congruency nothing as
4:37
I actually started purchasing my
4:39
competitors books and reading through
4:41
them I knew exactly what I needed to
4:43
include it's not as easy as just putting
4:45
into Chachi BT write me a book on
4:48
whatever initially this wasn't the way I
4:50
did it but this is the best way to do it
4:52
now you get Chachi PT to create the book
4:54
outline let's say for example you have
4:56
five chapters and then per each chapter
4:59
there are five topics you are going to
5:02
go through each Topic in each chapter
5:05
and generate that topic even though I
5:09
wasn't super experienced with writing
5:10
books people still like them the first
5:12
few ebooks that I put out they they
5:14
enjoyed what they were reading hey real
5:16
quick that business you want to start
5:17
let me show you how you can make your
5:19
first dollar ten times faster by using
5:21

5:23

5:38
dove into our case study about a
5:40
newsletter that makes 25 million dollars
5:42
a year just one month later he launched
5:43
his own newsletter that did five
5:45
thousand eight hundred dollars in
5:46
Revenue in the first 30 days
5:48
simple he studied what works implemented
5:50
it and avoided the mistakes of people
5:52
that were just a few steps ahead of him

can click the link below in the
5:59
description to get it much love and I
6:01
hope you guys enjoy the rest of the
Interview
6:02
video peace can you break down how much
6:04
profit you made and what the business is
6:07
valued at today two dates I've made 390k
6:10
dollars profit and my current valuation
6:13
is nine hundred and thirty thousand
6:15
dollars what's the typical profit margin
6:17
in a business like this my profit margin
6:20
is about 70 to 80 percent the only real
6:24
expense that takes away from my profit
6:27
is the ads I have my premium extension
6:30
subscriptions which is about 200 a month
6:33
creating books to create a full book
6:35
it's about three dollars with GPT three
6:37
and then I have my proofreader just go
6:39
through everything I have them on a
6:41
retainer but you can just do the
6:42
pre-freed ink yourself at the starting
6:44
when you started out you proofreaded
6:45
everything I did yeah I spent a lot of
6:47
time I would basically basically
6:48
generate a full book do a rough draft
6:50
and then I would meticulously go through
6:52
each chapter each subtopic just going
6:54
through the book and I just do one
6:56
revision of that and then I'd have a
6:58
good ready to go book tell me more about
7:00
the marketing side of things as I
7:01
understand uh you make money with ads
7:03
how specifically does that work majority
7:05
of my money has been made off of
7:07
Pinterest ads when you land on Pinterest
7:09
and you start with Pinterest ads you're
7:11
going to start off with consideration
7:13
campaigns and then you're gonna move
7:14
into conversion campaigns consideration
7:16
campaigns are going to give you a
7:18
general idea of which Niche you should
7:20
be selling your product in you're going
7:22
to test out different niches with
7:24
consideration campaigns then you're
7:26
going to go way more granular you're
7:27
going to set up your Pinterest tag and
7:29
then move into conversion campaigns
7:31
where you're really going to dial in
7:32
every single stat take a look at
7:34
everything your landing page copy
7:36
whether people are converting above the
7:37
full below the fold all of that tell me
7:40
a little bit about how the landing pages
7:41
work how do people find the landing
7:43
pages and and what's the purpose of them
7:45
the landing page is going to give you
7:48
room to show the lead value Stacks
7:51
what's provided chapter previews
7:53
everything it gives you so much more
7:55
real estate to sell them on the product
7:56
it's almost impossible to sell if you
7:59
don't do a landing page a landing page
8:01
is also the first touch point where the
8:04
lead is going to get a really good idea
8:06
of your overall brand image so if your
8:09
landing page is really really bad it
8:11
doesn't look professional they're gonna
8:12
bounce they're gonna bounce right away
8:13
and you're going to get a bounce rate of
8:15
over 80 percent over 70 percent that's
8:17
when you know that you know your landing
8:19
page just doesn't look professional with
8:21
AI books there's a low barrier to entry
8:23
right anybody can write an AI book and
8:25
sell it how do you approach competition
8:27
and things getting saturated I'm at a
8:30
point right now where my brand has so
8:33
much momentum when I see new competitors
8:35
coming to the space it doesn't scare me
8:37
it hasn't affected my profit and I don't
8:41
expect it I don't see it affecting my
8:42
profit in the future either because I
8:44
have such a loyal customer base there is
8:46
such a huge Market as as well I'm only
8:49
advertising on Pinterest when you take
8:52
Google ads Facebook into account there's
8:54
so much room for growth I'm sure there's
8:57
going to be many many like hundreds of
8:59
book Brands popping up but the market is
9:01
so huge by the point that I predict or
9:05
expect it to get saturated all be well
9:07
on my way I think that'll be years down
9:09
the line though and saturation just
9:11
means more competition it means you need
9:13
to be better at what you do provide more
9:15
value in your product and I think it's
9:17
good for people to stride towards
9:19
providing more value how sellable is a
9:22
business like this initially I didn't
9:24
think it would be super sellable and I
9:27
wanted to test the waters and what I did
9:29
is actually posted a bunch of the
9:31
details just on a few marketplaces I
9:34
just wanted to see what investors would
9:35
offer for my business the very first
9:37
offer I got for the entire business was
9:40
nine hundred and thirty thousand dollars
9:42
when I saw that number and I got the
9:44
email notification that I got an offer I
9:47
was like I'm really on to something here
9:49
now I'm actually working with an
9:53
investor who is purchasing 40 of my book
9:57
Brands and I'm able to continue building
10:00
up another book rant to then maybe sell
10:03
another 40 so it's a completely
10:05
repeatable process where you can build a
10:07
book brand sell it build another sell it
10:10
and it doesn't mean you have to sell
10:11
this whole Corporation you can sell just
10:13
parts of the corporation like what I'm
10:15
doing right now you made all this money
10:17
selling AI books uh what does a typical
10:19
day look like for you what's your
10:20
typical routine all of my mornings are
10:22
usually spent on making sure the ads are
10:25
running correctly making sure my
10:26
proofreader is doing what he needs to do
10:28
I'm just checking in with the business
10:29
now I'm working a lot and this is mostly
10:32
the afternoon I'm working on teaching
10:34
people how to build their own book brand
10:37
that's been extremely rewarding I've had
10:39
some really successful students they've
10:41
been absolutely killing it and then in
10:43
the night I actually make house music as
10:46
a hobby and I actually have a few songs
10:48
posted to my Spotify so AI music is that
10:51
the next thing yeah it could be it could
10:53
be yeah that's amazing what's your DJ
10:55
name it's just my name Joe popolis nice
10:57
yeah you made a lot of money as a 20
11:00
year old uh have you bought anything
11:01
cool with the profits I really haven't
11:04
bought a lot of things the only thing I
11:06
bought is just this Rolex and I know
11:08
it's going to keep its value I want to
11:10
stay away from depreciating assets as
11:12
much as I can for now I just want to
11:14
make a huge bag and then in the future
11:16
in the near future I'll invest and you
11:18
know get a nice car all that kind of
11:20
stuff but for now I'm just solely
11:21
focused on building businesses I'm very
11:23
lean and I want to stay that way for a
11:26
while if you could sit on Joe Pablo's
11:28
shoulder when you were just starting out
11:29
you you had a couple failed business
11:31
ventures what would you tell him I would
11:33
tell him to prioritize learning over
11:36
earning be more focused on learning the
11:39
skills building up a huge skill set
11:41
instead of being focused on how much I'm
11:43
earning it was almost impossible for me
11:44
to fail with the book brand because I
11:46
had built up so many skills beforehand
11:49
thank you Joe yeah follow us advice and
11:52
you will make millions with AI books
11:55
so yeah did you make house music I do
11:57
like house music do you want to hear the
11:58
latest songs

0:00
this is Charlie he makes $200,000 a
0:03
month with six different YouTube
0:05
channels and the crazy part is he's
0:07
actually an introvert I flew out to
0:10
California to get his story and ask him
0:12
exactly how he got good at YouTube and
0:15
the monetization strategy he uses to
0:17
make over $2.4 million a year most of my
0:21
money is made through right now Charlie
0:23
started his journey making $0 for months
0:27
then he learned a secret and created one
0:30
video that would change everything in
0:33
the actual video itself we had a lot of
0:35
so that's really how you get people to
0:37
click on it and then actually watch the
0:38
entire video in this video he breaks
0:41
down the blueprint for how anyone can
0:43
make $200,000 a month with YouTube how
0:45
to create videos that get millions of
0:47
views and his advice for all new
0:50
entrepreneurs just starting out I focus
0:53
on not just making viral videos but I'm
0:56
Pat walls and this is starter story
0:59
thanks for having me man your place is
1:01
awesome thank you thanks for coming tell
1:03
me about yourself and what you built I'm
1:04
Charlie I'm 31 years old and I am an
1:07
entrepreneur in Southern California I
1:10
currently have six plus YouTube channels
1:13
on the typical month we'll do 200 to
1:17
250k in Revenue we just had our best
1:19
month ever this month we'll do close to
1:21
300K that's for the YouTube channels and
1:24
then for the staffing company we started
1:26
that last year it's a low six figure
1:28
company right now but I'm putting most
1:30
of my energy into that one cuz we want
1:31
to grow it and be able to maybe get
1:33
acquired someday all right if you can
1:34
break down a little bit more about all
1:36
the channels and all the businesses that
1:37
you've built and how you make money so
1:40
my main channel is just called Charlie
1:41
Chang my name we have I think 1.1
1:43
million subscribers I have another
1:45
Channel called SARP wise has about
1:46
50,000 subscribers and then we have
1:48
Charlie Chang show the penthouse my
1:50
first website is one we just started it
1:52
has like 600 subscribers as of right now
1:55
most of my money is made through
1:56
affiliate marketing right now I'd say
1:58
about 50 to 55% of the revenue that
2:00
comes in we also do brand sponsorships
2:02
so that's usually like 20 25% and then
2:06
AdSense is also going to be 20 25%
2:09
that's across all the different channels
2:11
yeah so you're a subscriber of starter
2:12
story right I am yeah for about I think
2:14
6 months now nice what do you like about
2:16
it or what do you use it for so I think
2:18
a huge part of how I was able to do
2:20
pretty well was because I spent a lot of
2:22
my time brainstorming learning like
2:24
seeing what other people do so that's
2:26
why yeah I think I get a ton of value
2:28
from Star Story just because these are
2:30
crazy case studies it just allows me to
2:32
stay on Trends it allows me to see how
2:34
other people do it I sort of view it as
2:35
like a mentorship yeah that's awesome if
2:38
anyone is looking for ideas for their
2:40
own business you can check out
2:41
starterstory.com learn from thousands of
2:43
Founders who are just a few steps ahead
2:45
of you people that haven't necessarily
2:47
rais money from VC or you know have
2:50
super rich parents these are case
2:52
studies of people that turned a simple
2:54
side projects or passive income sources
2:56
into businesses that completely changed
2:58
their lives so check check it out in the
3:00
link in the description tell me about
3:02
what life was like growing up and how
3:04
you became an entrepreneur so I grew up
3:06
in a non-entrepreneurial household my
3:09
parents really wanted me to be a doctor
3:11
went to college not knowing what I was
3:13
going to do after I graduated could not
3:15
find a job for the life of me so I
3:17
basically just started doing work for
3:19
myself I've done like every side hustle
3:21
in the world photography video print
3:23
modeling and like a little bit of acting
3:25
I started a clothing brand I had
3:28
marketing agency real estate mortgages
3:30
everything it was definitely hard though
3:32
because when I first graduated college I
3:34
was basically making $0 seeing all my
3:37
friends with their high paying like
3:39
accounting jobs it didn't make me feel
3:41
good I sort of felt like not successful
3:44
but I think there are a lot of people
3:45
out there in this similar situation
3:46
where they don't want to go the
3:48
traditional route they don't want to do
3:49
something that their parents want them
3:51
to do and if I could just tell them one
3:52
thing it's like with enough persistence
3:54
with enough risk-taking you can just
3:56
pretty much do anything you want after a
3:58
little bit I sort of started getting
4:00
some more clients and stuff like that I
4:01
was making about like $50,000 and then
4:05
in
4:06
2020 that's basically when the YouTube
4:08
channel started taking off I think I
4:10
made $750 in one single day from AdSense
4:13
and that's when I was like dang this is
4:15
this could be something big what did you
4:16
do after that I just basically started
4:19
learning a ton about YouTube how to
4:21
monetize how to make more content did a
4:23
ton of brainstorming on what types of
4:25
content I can make that were doing well
4:27
at that time I started making videos
4:29
Almost every single day I was like if I
4:31
can make this opportunity work it's
4:32
going to be life-changing the growth was
4:34
pretty fast like 500 to 1,000
4:36
subscribers per day in terms of AdSense
4:38
we were doing maybe 10 to 20K a month
4:42
yeah so that was a huge change for me
4:44
wow and were you just doing all by
4:45
yourself then you said we but was it
4:47
just you yeah that was completely me I
4:49
did everything myself yeah how long did
4:51
it take to actually get good at YouTube
4:53
I'd say one or two years I started
4:55
making Finance content in 2018 and my
4:58
first videos were super bad a big thing
5:01
that got me to be pretty good at YouTube
5:03
was just being able to present
5:04
information in a way that makes people
5:06
want to stay and that they can actually
5:08
understand people watching YouTube
5:10
aren't going to be super technical so
5:12
you have to really break it down in a
5:13
way that's easy to understand even if
5:15
you're super introverted like I am even
5:17
if you don't have like natural ability
5:19
on camera you can get good at what are
5:22
little things that you would advise for
5:23
people to improve as they keep making
5:25
videos I'd say It's always important to
5:27
up your production quality or improve
5:29
improve some aspect of your videos
5:31
whether it be camera audio storytelling
5:33
stuff like that I think everyone needs
5:35
to go into any business especially
5:37
YouTube thinking I just need to make
5:40
enough videos until I get one that pops
5:42
off I also think it's really important
5:44
to be brainstorming and thinking about
5:47
different potential pivots you can make
5:49
for example when crypto was booming I
5:52
started making content about crypto when
5:54
stocks were booming I started making
5:55
content about stocks when side hustles
5:57
were booming I started making content
5:58
about side hustles
6:00
I understand what types of things people
6:02
are looking for and I make content that
6:05
doesn't need to be brand new for it to
6:08
be relevant mhm how do you really get
6:10
views on YouTube how do you make great
6:12
videos that get millions of views I
6:14
focus on not just making viral videos
6:17
but making videos that people are
6:19
searching for one of my most popular
6:21
videos is just talking about my
6:22
different sources of income so something
6:24
like that where you have an age that
6:26
people can relate to big number like 10
6:28
sources of income like wo and then a
6:30
dollar amount just really makes them
6:32
curious to click on it those types of
6:34
titles have done really well for me so a
6:35
huge part of my channel is Evergreen SEO
6:39
content for example how to invest in
6:41
stocks I'll make something like that
6:42
that's something that people are
6:43
actively searching for I don't Focus
6:45
just on the virality I prefer to go the
6:48
searchable route in terms of the videos
6:50
that perform extremely well too for
6:53
example I did a video called asking
6:55
Coachella VIPs what they do for a living
6:57
I thought that was the Perfect Blend of
6:58
an exper experience that most people
7:00
don't get to have good thumbnail it was
7:03
also trending cuz Coachella was
7:04
happening at the time and then in the
7:06
actual video we had a lot of
7:08
Storytelling so that's really how you
7:10
get people to click on it and then
7:11
actually watch the entire video yeah
7:13
what kind of tools and software do you
7:14
use to run your business and to improve
7:17
your business so all of our content
7:19
planning is on clickup we use frame.io
7:22
for uploading footage and having our
7:24
editors put draft on there we make
7:26
revision comments stuff like that
7:27
there's tools like one of 10 and creater
7:30
hooks Pro to come up with thumbnail
7:33
ideas and title ideas we have a pretty
7:35
big team now for all team communication
7:37
we use slack so that's been great in
7:39
terms of managing a lot of our talent we
7:40
use hubstaff which is a super good time
7:43
tracking tool and then in terms of AI
7:45
tools we are using a good amount of them
7:47
to help with the content production
7:49
process just to make it more efficient
7:51
for example for short form content we
7:53
use submic descript and we use Opus
7:57
those really help us be able to push out
7:58
a lot of short short form content from
8:00
our long form content that's something I
8:01
always tell people if you make long form
8:04
content you might as well cut that up
8:05
into short form content all right let's
8:07
break down some of the financials behind
8:09
the business how much does it cost to
8:11
run this business and what does your
8:12
team look like for the media business we
8:14
currently have 26 people there's me
8:17
there's my coo which is the other guy
8:19
that's local under him we basically have
8:21
two or three different project managers
8:23
each of those project managers works
8:25
with a ton of video editors thumbnail
8:27
people a graphics person website person
8:30
a lot of miscellaneous roles like that
8:31
in terms of the cost to run that team
8:34
it's about 20 $225,000 a month and
8:37
that's because we're just so heavily
8:38
using overseas talent and how are you
8:40
able to find uh a lot of these team
8:42
members combination of upwork Fiverr
8:44
online jobs but most of our current team
8:46
members are actually from paired which
8:48
is the overseas Staffing Company you're
8:50
using your own app to oh yeah 100% yeah
8:53
it's the perfect pairing yeah hiring
8:55
overseas is great but it's super hard to
8:57
find really talented people so we
8:59
basically have our local recruitment
9:01
teams they go out there they'll sort
9:03
through like 3 to 500 people find the
9:06
best one or two people and then present
9:08
those people to you so that's basically
9:09
what our service does and what what kind
9:11
of cost would people be looking at uh if
9:13
they wanted to hire someone through your
9:14
company yeah so we charge a onetime
9:16
placement fee we don't take money from
9:17
the client and then pass it on to the
9:19
talent it's a full handoff which saves
9:21
people a lot of money a full-time person
9:23
for most positions I'd say is about $600
9:26
to $11,000 per month you have these
9:28
successful YouTube channels and now
9:29
you're starting a little bit of a
9:31
different business uh with your Staffing
9:32
firm why did you decide to start that I
9:35
want to be more of a traditional
9:36
entrepreneur where I have equity in a
9:38
business and while I have the channels
9:40
behind me the marketing it makes sense
9:41
to build something that I can use my
9:43
channels to help grow all right so for
9:45
anyone watching that wants to get into
9:46
entrepreneurship what should they do
9:48
surround yourself with content and
9:50
people that are doing it it just makes
9:51
it seem like it's all possible right and
9:53
then I would try and learn a some type
9:55
of high value skill there's tons of
9:57
skills you can learn within a few months
9:58
I I think that you can start to monetize
10:00
they all sort of build on top of each
10:02
other and they all allow you to be
10:03
better at the next thing personally for
10:05
me I've never built a company that took
10:07
up a ton of capital to start I think
10:09
doing some type of agency or service
10:11
based business is the best way for
10:12
anyone to to get started for any of the
10:14
viewers watching if you want to get
10:15
started with an agency or service model
10:18
you can check out our 100 product High
10:21
Services where you can learn exactly how
10:23
businesses are using the product service
10:24
model how much money they make how they
10:26
grew how they got customers that's in
10:28
the link Down Below in the description
10:30
another thing that I've learned recently
10:32
is really not trying to do everything
10:34
myself I used to think that I wanted to
10:35
be a solar preneur for the rest of my
10:37
life but after you hire your first
10:39
person you realize okay this is what an
10:41
actual business is right because it's a
10:43
business that can run without yourself
10:45
you don't need to always be there for it
10:47
to work some people that might be
10:48
watching this may be feeling a little
10:50
bit of analysis Paralysis on what idea
10:52
they should start uh what's your answer
10:54
to that what I would tell them is just
10:55
don't overanalyze it pick something if
10:57
it's the wrong answer if it's the wrong
10:59
thing then you'll just learn from that
11:00
and you won't make that mistake if it's
11:02
the right thing then you made a fast
11:03
decision right I think speed for
11:06
Successful People is such a universal
11:08
trait for anyone that thinks they're in
11:10
a rut or they want to have a big
11:13
breakthrough I'd say one thing they can
11:14
do is really change their environment or
11:16
change their routine like completely and
11:18
same thing with location if you're stuck
11:20
in a city where you feel like you're not
11:22
growing as much as you should be move to
11:24
a different city all right tell me what
11:26
a day in the life is like for you every
11:28
day is quite different which I think is
11:30
the best part about entrepreneurship at
11:31
least for me I usually wake up 5:30 to
11:34
6:30 a.m. do a little morning routine
11:37
probably hit the gym get some work done
11:39
and then the rest of the day is just
11:41
working going out how much do you
11:43
usually work per day I'd say a typical
11:45
work week is going to be 30 to 50 hours
11:48
of actual work and then who knows how
11:51
much brainstorming and thinking about it
11:53
so you're always on kind of thing I
11:55
think I'm always on it's like a
11:56
lifestyle business right I try and make
11:58
my life part part of the business and I
12:01
enjoy having that mix yeah what do you
12:03
like to do for fun or for leisure I like
12:07
to work out I like to watch Netflix with
12:10
my girlfriend play Pickleball play music
12:13
and this business is also afford to you
12:15
some nice cars you have a a car buying
12:17
habit I would say it's a car buying
12:19
habit but yeah I have three cars now I
12:21
guess what you got I have a RV Sprinter
12:23
van that we just got I have a Range
12:25
Rover and I have a Ferrari why did you
12:28
buy the Sprinter van
12:29
uh tax right off if you were to give any
12:32
advice to your younger self when you
12:34
were just starting out for with the side
12:35
hustles what would that be I think it'd
12:37
be to carve out my own identity myself
12:39
rather than try and do things that are
12:41
expected or that society says is normal
12:44
so I've been a people pleaser I think
12:45
all my life I always felt sort of out of
12:47
place because I want to do different
12:49
projects and things I couldn't really
12:51
ever talk with other people that want do
12:53
something similar moving here meeting so
12:55
many entrepreneurs getting to pursue
12:57
entrepreneurship myself it's really
12:59
allowed me to grow as a person and be
13:01
surrounded by the energy that I've I
13:03
think always wanted to be surrounded by
13:05
awesome thank you so much Charlie than a
13:08
pleasure follow this advice and you will
13:10
be a
13:11
multi-million doll and multi-million

Transcript:
0:00
all right what's your story 6 years ago
0:02
I started a business today that business
0:05
makes over a million dollar a year but
0:07
what nobody knows is that I built it
0:09
inside of a Starbucks at the time I was
0:12
working a full-time job I'm still
0:14
working my 9 to-5 job right here and
0:17
that left me with only 2 hours a day to
0:19
build the business of my dreams but
0:22
there was still one problem I was
0:24
suffocated by self-doubt I didn't
0:27
believe I could do it then I found
0:30
something that would change my life
0:31
forever today I'm going to tell you that
0:34
story I'm Pat walls and this is my
0:36
starter
0:38
[Music]
0:42
story all right this is me in the summer
0:46
of 2017 I'm 26 years old I've got a
0:49
great job I'm making six figures in New
0:51
York City and by all accounts living the
0:53
life of my dreams but deep down I know
0:56
that something isn't right every day I
0:58
go to work and do the same same
1:00
clock in a few Zoom meetings eat lunch
1:03
write a few lines of code and clock out
1:06
this work leaves me feeling empty every
1:08
day I know this isn't what I meant to do
1:11
I know there's something missing see
The Idea
1:14
here's the truth and it might be
1:15
something you felt at some point too
1:17
secretly in the back of my head I dream
1:20
about the idea of quitting my job and
1:22
starting my own business in my free time
1:24
I'm reading business books and
1:25
romanticizing about being able to wake
1:27
up and work on whatever I want but I
1:29
keep running into the same problem I
1:32
have no idea where to start how do I
1:34
find a good idea how do I know it can
1:36
make money how do I take the first step
1:39
I couldn't find this information
1:41
anywhere online and that's when I had my
1:43
light bulb moment I can turn these
1:45
questions into a product I'll just
1:47
research successful businesses write
1:50
about my findings on a Blog and share
1:52
them with others who also want to learn
1:54
and I didn't think this was going to be
1:55
a big thing I was just genuinely
1:57
interested in this stuff so this is is
1:59
the beginning of the idea but it's not
2:02
all peaches and cream from there this
2:04
idea it nags at me for months every
2:07
single day I tell myself I'll get
2:10
started on it but I never
The Starbucks
2:13
do and this is where Starbucks comes
2:16
into play so let me pull up a map and
2:18
show you this is New York City this is
2:21
where I live this is where I work and
2:24
this is the Starbucks every day I walk
2:26
home from work and I walk by the
2:28
Starbucks and every day I tell myself
2:31
I'll stop in there order a drink sit
2:33
down and get started on this idea but
2:35
every single day I walk by that
2:37
Starbucks take one hard look at it
2:39
proceed to not go inside walk home and
2:43
watch 6 hours of Netflix and then go to
2:45
bed and I do this every day for months
2:48
this Starbucks it represents the unknown
2:51
and it's too scary for me to confront
2:54
it but everything changes when I come
Deep Work
2:57
across this book it's called deep work
3:00
by Cal Newport and deep work is a state
3:02
of focus that you must learn if you want
3:04
to do hard things after reading this
3:07
book I realize that I'm completely
3:09
lacking Focus so I put together a
3:11
contract with myself in this contract I
3:14
write down and I visualize tomorrow I'm
3:17
going to walk in that Starbucks I'm
3:19
going to order a coffee I'm going to sit
3:21
down I'm going to set a timer for 2
3:23
hours and I'm going to just focus that's
3:26
the contract the next day day one I walk
3:29
in that Starbucks I sit down I set my
3:32
timer and I get started all of a sudden
3:34
the timer goes off I look up and think
3:37
holy that was 2 hours that flew by
3:41
I was in Flow State I was actually doing
3:44
deep work day two I walk into Starbucks
3:47
and do it again and day three I do it
3:50
again and I don't stop every single day
3:54
I get off work walk into that Starbucks
3:56
and do my 2 hours of deep work I even
3:58
start waking up at 6:00 in the morning
4:00
and getting my deepor in before my
4:02
full-time job even starts I'm doing it
4:04
every day and it feels effortless in the
Progress
4:07
progress it starts to happen after 1
4:09
month I've come up with a name and
4:11
concept for my idea I'm going to call it
4:13
starter story and I land the domain
4:15
starterstory.com for $12 a year I launch
4:18
it with a few stories and a few hundred
4:20
people visit the website after 2 months
4:22
I've published dozens of stories and I'm
4:24
starting to find a routine the business
4:26
isn't making any money but I'm starting
4:28
to build a tiny audience I then start a
4:30
newsletter and get my first 100
4:32
subscribers after 4 months I start
4:34
working on marketing and I get my first
4:35
big break one of my stories goes viral
4:38
on Reddit and thousands of people crash
4:40
my site and join the newsletter now I'm
4:42
starting to feel like my idea is
4:44
validated after 6 months I start
4:46
thinking about monetization and how I
4:48
can make my first dollar I monetize the
4:50
newsletter with a sponsorship and I
4:52
start making some money from affiliate
4:54
Revenue now I'm starting to feel more
4:56
confident like I actually kind of get
4:58
how this stuff works and and I'm having
5:00
fun in the
5:04
process so this whole thing starts out
New Problem
5:07
as a project that I didn't really expect
5:08
would go anywhere but then it gets
5:10
traction and now I'm left with a new
5:12
problem I need to figure out how this
5:14
thing can make money but everything on
5:16
the internet is about how VC backed Tech
5:18
Giants raised $100 million when I just
5:21
want to figure out how I can go from $0
5:23
a month to5 or $10,000 a month how do I
5:26
figure this out by reading case studies
5:28
about businesses that that are just a
5:30
few steps ahead of me and that's what
5:31
starter story is we have over 4,000 case
5:34
studies and business breakdowns on
5:36
successful online businesses that were
5:38
started by people like you and me in
5:40
these case studies you can see exactly
5:42
how much these businesses make and
5:44
exactly how they got started so if
5:46
you're curious on what it takes to build
5:48
a business to5 or $10,000 a month or
5:50
even a million doll online business
5:52
check out starterstory.com or click the
5:54
first link in the description we're
5:56
running a special right now for the
5:57
YouTube family so how does this turn
How Does This Turn Into A Business
6:00
into a business well I'm reading case
6:02
studies about businesses similar to mine
6:04
and I realize that most of them make
6:06
their money through
6:07
sponsorships then something amazing
6:10
happens I get an email it's from the CEO
6:13
of a company called clavio they're a
6:15
huge company now but at the time they
6:16
were smaller the email says hi Pat I
6:19
love starter story and what you're doing
6:21
both the stories and sharing your
6:22
progress keep crushing it AB it's a nice
6:25
email to get but I don't really think
6:27
too much of it but as the conversation
6:28
goes on we start to talk about the
6:30
potential of clavio sponsoring the
6:32
newsletter and then he comes to me with
6:33
a number
6:35
$112,000 when I see this I don't believe
6:38
it at the time I was basically living
6:40
paycheck to paycheck so $122,000 was
6:42
more money than I'd ever seen in my life
6:45
I send in my bank details and sure
6:47
enough a few days later the money hits
6:49
my account I get the notification while
6:51
I'm at Starbucks and my heart starts
6:53
beating out of my chest I get up leave
6:56
the Starbucks and just take a walk
6:57
around the block my head is swirling
6:59
with emotions this is crazy I got
7:02
$112,000 deposited into my bank account
7:05
because of something that I built I felt
7:08
like I had just become a millionaire all
7:10
those days of waking up at 6:00 in the
7:11
morning going to Starbucks and putting
7:13
in those 2 hours of deep work this money
7:16
was the direct result of that I felt
7:18
like I was on top of the world but these
7:20
emotions of excitement of bliss it
7:23
quickly turned to fear I thought was
7:25
this email some sort of accident did I
7:27
just get lucky this $122,000
7:29
it represented a decision that I had to
7:31
make in my life should I keep playing it
7:34
safe and keep my full-time job or was
7:37
this $112,000 validation that I should
7:39
go all in on one side the devil on my
7:42
shoulder was saying go all in and the
7:44
angel was saying no keep playing it safe
7:47
and I sat on the fence for months but
7:49
then I remembered why I started this
7:51
thing in the first place I wanted to
7:53
build something for myself and not
7:55
someone else's dream I realized that if
7:57
I don't make this decision right now I
7:59
might never do it I might get old look
8:01
back and wonder what if and that was the
8:04
moment that I walked into work and I
8:05
handed in my resignation I quit my job
8:08
decided to go all in on starter story
8:10
and the rest is
8:12
[Music]
8:16
history all right fast forward 5 years
Fast Forward 5 Years
8:19
and that was the last time I had a
8:20
regular job the last time I ever got a
8:23
paycheck after that I never looked back
8:25
I never stopped building and I ended up
8:28
building starter story into a
8:29
million-dollar business I'm not going to
8:31
lie to you and tell you that it was all
8:32
easy or predictable from there I failed
8:35
a ton but when I look back the most
8:37
important thing that I did was just
8:39
going inside that Starbucks getting to
8:41
work and taking action every single day
8:43
I was giving myself a chance to become
8:45
lucky and it took me a few months to get
8:47
there but when it did when that email
8:49
came through when that $12,000 came
8:51
through I decided to go all in after
8:53
that and that is really what made the
8:56
difference that's the story of how I
8:58
built a million our business from inside
9:00
of Starbucks and I would like to thank
9:02
Starbucks for sponsoring this video just
9:06
kidding

interview it's a master class of what it
0:54
takes to build a 10 million online
0:56
business I'm Pat walls and this is
0:58
starter story
All his businesses
1:01
iPod that you're running multiple
1:03
businesses right now can you give us a
1:04
breakdown of everything that you've
1:05
built yeah so we actually started off
1:08
doing custom fraternity and sorority
1:10
merchandise custom is the key word right
1:12
at the end of the day we we went after
1:15
one niche market which was serving
1:17
fraternities sororities on campus but we
1:19
were doing custom stuff for their events
1:21
which then led into doing custom stuff
1:23
for the colleges and departments on
1:25
campus we went ahead and got essentially
1:27
300 College licenses to do all that
1:29
merchandise for the campus organizations
1:32
departments on campus and then naturally
1:34
as we started growing out our sales team
1:36
we started getting ancillary business to
1:38
do custom merchandise for businesses so
1:40
then we launched threadly which is our
1:42
custom apparel business for businesses
1:45
you know fundraisers non-profits and
1:48
then in the last year with us kind of
1:50
building out these other businesses we
1:52
built Tech along the way to kind of
1:54
manage these different brands and all
1:56
the back-end processes and us being in
1:58
the license space for so long we
2:00
actually saw an opportunity when the
2:02
name image likeness Supreme Court ruling
2:04
came out where student athletes can
2:05
monetize on their name image and
2:07
likeness so with that we actually got
2:10
into making merchandise co-branded with
2:12
the college and the athlete which is the
2:15
brand is athlete's thread and so really
2:17
focused on custom branded merchandise
2:19
and licensed merchandise is the two
2:21
buckets that I would put it in as far as
2:23
what we do as a whole but it is kind of
2:26
Nest within four Brands so you got Greek
2:28
house for fraternities and sororities
2:30
College thread for all the Departments
2:32
and organizations threadly for corporate
2:35
companies and then now athletes thread
2:37
for athletes and colleges yeah so
2:39
essentially you know different niches
2:41
within the apparel industry and these
2:43
are all websites where people can buy
2:44
merchandise like Shopify websites or
2:46
exactly so one is custom right you would
2:49
come to us and say hey we want this
2:50
custom design or product made we would
2:52
design it and produce it for you on a
2:55
kind of like a bulk basis or bulk order
2:57
basis so that's a little bit less on the
2:59
direct to Consumer side it's more
3:00
business to business but then yes for
3:03
athlete's threat you're coming on and
3:05
you're buying one item for for that
3:07
athlete in college and just use yeah
3:09
through Shopify tell us a little bit
Finding the idea
3:11
about your life before athletes threaten
3:13
your business that you're running what's
3:14
the journey that brought you to building
3:15
this business yeah so one of my
3:18
fraternity brothers and I we just saw a
3:20
need to fill the market with just a
3:22
better vendor on the custom apparel side
3:24
and this was back in 2013 when you know
3:27
technology was really really kind of
3:29
coming to the Forefront of every
3:30
business we really rode that train hard
3:33
and we started building out an order
3:35
management platform as well as a
3:37
customer portal but as we were figuring
3:40
out this business Luke and I my
3:42
co-founder we were actually starting a
3:44
bunch of other businesses so we had a
3:46
promotions company where we threw
3:47
concerts we had a discount card that we
3:50
would sell to uh students student
3:52
organizations to raise money and then we
3:54
had this apparel business and you know
3:55
uh Luke also started a storage company a
3:58
storage and retrieval company for
4:00
College college students so we had
4:03
multiple tries at entrepreneurship in
4:04
college but this one it happened you
4:06
know the first year we did 50 000 second
4:09
version a hundred thousand and this was
4:10
us kind of working on it part time in
4:13
between school doing all the stuff that
4:15
a student would do and then also um our
4:17
other businesses we were trying to stand
4:18
up and get running as well and then upon
Building the business with a full time job
4:21
graduation I actually got a full-time
4:23
job at Amazon you had a full-time job
4:25
and you're working on this on the side
4:26
uh yeah I mean it was uh you know what
4:28
was crazy about Amazon was I had to work
4:30
from Wednesday night to Sunday morning
4:33
so I'd come in Wednesday night at
4:36
literally 11 pm and I would get off
4:38
between 11 A.M to 12 p.m go home sleep
4:43
and then I'd wake up in the evening
4:44
start working on Greek house then go
4:47
into Amazon do it all over again
4:49
um and in Salesforce same cycle but I
4:51
had a little bit of a more normal
4:52
schedule I'd go in at you know 8 A.M and
4:55
I'd get off around 5 36 and then I'd be
4:58
working till midnight and do it all over
5:00
again and then week guns you know
5:02
typically got maybe one weekend day off
5:04
uh Saturday but yeah it was it was
5:07
pretty much Six Days on
5:09
um and one day off kind of deal for a
5:11
good good two two and a half years we'll
How he stays motivated
5:13
give you the motivation to do all that
5:15
for so long yeah so um my family's an
5:18
immigrant you know have really humble
5:21
beginnings since we moved here
5:23
um you know I we immigrated to from
5:25
India to here I was born in Bangalore
5:27
when I was seven years old so I think
5:30
one we've you know I've always seen my
5:32
parents work hard and I think that's
5:34
always hard work has always been
5:35
instilled in me um but two you know my
5:37
parents gave up everything from a family
5:39
perspective to to move my brother and I
5:42
over here and now my sister is here as
5:45
well
5:46
um but you know we we just you know
5:48
we're very fortunate to have the
5:49
opportunity to live in a country where
5:51
the opportunities you know you can go
5:53
out and get it and so uh you know I
5:55
think just wanting to make my parents
5:57
proud it would be like number two and
5:59
just like really I think that's
6:01
supersedes almost everything but three
6:03
you know I think ultimately uh you know
6:05
every time I go back to India or you
6:07
know we have employees all over the
6:09
world I just like realize how fortunate
6:11
I am and we are to live in a country
6:13
like the US to be able to build startups
6:16
without barriers so
6:18
um yeah you know I think it's just it's
6:19
just what I've always known
6:21
um you know I have entrepreneurship all
6:23
throughout my family we have you know
6:25
over 24 restaurants in India so it runs
6:28
all throughout our family as well so I'd
6:31
say It's a combination of all that and
6:33
I'm just very fortunate that I get to do
6:34
this every day all right so you started
How he started the business (early days)
6:36
Greek House in your dorm room or your
6:38
college basement with only 500 bucks
6:40
what did that look like at the time yeah
6:43
so um we were basically in our
6:45
fraternity house and so we would
6:48
literally meet in the common areas and
6:51
and basically get a sales plan going and
6:54
um you know a lot of what we did to
6:55
start our business was there's Savvy
6:58
college kids and this is before you know
7:00
we had in Instagram and different ways
7:03
to reach the you know different folks
7:05
there we would just go out start texting
7:07
our friends and in different sororities
7:10
and fraternities try and figure out
7:11
who's making the decision to buy
7:13
T-shirts and just we're out there
7:14
hustling and kind of working through our
7:16
networks meeting people on campus going
7:18
to different you know the student
7:20
organization meetings going and pitching
7:22
to them there on hey you should use us
7:24
to buy your shirts and that was kind of
7:26
our Edge was we were these young
7:27
Hustlers that could go out and just you
7:30
know we were we were sharp we really
7:32
liked sales and really just going out
7:33
and pitching people and you know we
7:35
probably sucked at sales in the
7:36
beginning but you know over time you get
7:38
better and better your pitch gets
7:40
refined but you know putting yourself
7:41
out there and just going for it it's the
7:44
best thing you can do as a college
7:45
student so I always tell students to
7:48
just go for it if you're in college you
7:51
know there's no reason you can't be
7:52
starting a side hustle or a business
7:54
while you're in school
7:56
[Music]
Scariest moments
8:01
I know building a licensing business can
8:04
be complicated are there any really
8:05
scary moments while building this
8:07
business or any big obstacles that you
8:09
had to get through to get where you are
8:10
today yeah actually
8:12
um when I went first went full time with
8:14
the business in 2016 you know moved all
8:17
my stuff down to Los Angeles where my
8:20
two other business partners were one of
8:21
my co-founders were there uh you know
8:24
we're we're three months in and uh
8:25
things are going great you know sales
8:27
are picking up we're seeing a lot of
8:29
growth working a lot of hours but having
8:31
a lot of fun working our living room at
8:34
this one middle desk in a really small
8:36
apartment in La just really working and
8:38
grinding away but you know about a month
8:42
about four months in in April we get a
8:44
notice from one of the licensing
8:45
organizations saying hey you're not
8:47
paying royalties and we're finding out
8:49
that there's all these sales that you're
8:52
basically not reporting on and we're
8:54
like what are you talking about and so
8:55
we started looking into it and ended up
8:57
finding out a way licensing's a whole
9:00
thing we have to get approved rude we
9:02
have to pay royalties and so we
9:04
basically got audited and long long
9:07
story short we had a forty thousand
9:09
dollar bill four months into it which
9:11
you know at the time you know we were
9:13
doing just under a million in sales and
9:16
that was really scary right that's like
9:18
four percent of our costs and we didn't
9:21
even have 40K in the bank to roll with
9:23
and so you know we went back to the
9:25
licensing agency and said hey you know
9:27
we want to be in this industry for the
9:29
long term you know we will make it right
9:32
give us some time to make these payments
9:34
we'll give you one lump sum now and the
9:36
rest over the course of you know 12 14
9:39
months and so um it was a very valuable
9:41
lesson but you know at the time you know
9:42
I thought I was gonna have to go back to
9:44
work full time working in in Corporate
9:46
America
Fulfillment and logistics
9:49
I know you probably have a million skus
9:52
how do you ship out all this take orders
9:54
and and manage this whole operation yeah
9:57
so we've uh we've built out a supply
9:59
chain
10:00
um so we don't manufacture anything
10:01
in-house but we work with amazing print
10:04
and production Partners all throughout
10:06
the US and so that's been accumulation
10:09
of just us building relationships over
10:12
the last 10 years but in most Industries
10:14
right on a distributor level like us
10:16
it's easy to find
10:18
manufacturers it's hard to find good
10:21
manufacturers or great manufacturing
10:23
partners and so these are relationships
10:25
we've had to develop over the years but
10:27
in managing that right one is we've
10:30
built out a Vendor Portal so that they
10:32
can manage all their orders effectively
10:33
so in some cases you know we've come
10:36
into that shop that we work with the the
10:38
printer production partner and said hey
10:40
you know we want to work with you these
10:42
are our prices but we are also going to
10:44
provide you Tech so that when you
10:46
service our account it takes one tenth
10:49
of time to service than it does for your
10:51
other customers because we're going to
10:53
keep everything so organized and so
10:55
clean for you so that you know you don't
10:57
have to to to manage 100 other aspects
11:00
of the admin side of the workload and so
11:03
um that's what's really kind of led us
11:05
to having great Partners is being able
11:07
to build out you know systems and
11:09
processes for them that makes their job
11:11
easy so that you know there's no
11:13
question when an order comes through on
11:15
what needs to be printed who it needs to
11:17
go to we give that to them in an
11:18
organized fashion and we've helped
11:20
automate and streamline their workflows
11:22
on the production line all right let's
How to build in saturated markets
11:23
talk about competition in the e-commerce
11:25
space anyone can start a Shopify store
11:27
and I know that 90 of Shopify stores
11:30
fail so how do you differentiate
11:33
yourself as a brand and how do you look
11:35
at competition one from a like just a
11:39
company and Landscape perspective what's
11:41
great about being in the licensed
11:42
industry right there is a lot of hurdles
11:45
to get to where we are first and
11:47
foremost you need to have licenses for
11:49
the call colleges and then you need to
11:51
get rights for from each athlete so that
11:54
hurdle alone
11:55
99.99 of companies will not get through
12:00
that hurdle so that really Slims down
12:02
you know the vendors and the competition
12:04
in the first place the second area that
12:06
we've really been focusing on is
12:08
building a true brand so you know we
12:10
went from doing custom merchandise to
How to build a brand
12:12
now doing our own brand with athletes
12:14
thread right and how we've been
12:16
differentiating from building a brand I
12:18
mean one is amazing customer service and
12:20
turnaround time right when we ship
12:22
product out you know that is the first
12:24
kind of like way that we differentiate
12:26
is making sure that each customer when
12:29
they reach out to us they're getting a
12:30
response in less than four hours time
12:32
they are also you know products are not
12:34
shipping out in the two to three
12:35
business days we guarantee we harp on
12:38
our vendors to really get those out and
12:40
making sure that we meet our slas and so
12:43
that's the first area where our brand is
12:44
really strong is good product and good
12:46
product delivery the next area I would
12:49
say
12:50
is that we've been doing a lot of things
12:51
around our brand so we're doing neck
12:53
labels we're doing custom packaging so
12:56
really starting to build a brand there
12:58
and then the third is from a social
13:00
media perspective right we have a fairly
13:01
young team who loves sports so we're
13:04
really trying to lean into that and so
13:06
really put out really engaging and cool
13:08
content that not just the students Vibe
13:11
with but the athletes survive with and
13:13
also the sports teams the individual
13:16
teams right they all Vibe with
Marketing strategies
13:19
marketing is the hardest thing to do as
13:21
a business it's easy to start a business
13:23
hard to grow it what is your marketing
13:25
strategy look like and what's all the
13:27
ways that you get sales and reach
13:28
customers yeah so when we first started
13:31
we went deep into a few different
13:33
channels we originally started with
13:36
outbound email marketing which is
13:38
one-to-one emails called outreaches and
13:40
then that turned into outbound sales so
13:43
we were going much more of a direct
13:44
response route and that's what really
13:46
worked for us it was cost effective
13:48
scalable we were able to find a lot of
13:50
emails and contacts online the second
13:52
approach that's really worked for us is
13:54
building out an affiliate or an
13:55
ambassador program right what's great
13:57
about those kinds of programs is that
13:59
you're not just spreading your word
14:01
about the product you're finding
14:03
Advocates that are selling your brand on
14:06
your behalf right whether they're you
14:08
know posting content they're sending it
14:10
to their friends they're posting their
14:12
discount codes you know what's great
14:13
about that is you know if you do send
14:16
them free product yes that's some
14:18
initial investment up front but they can
14:20
also give you content on the back end
14:22
right so that you're able to reuse it
14:23
repurpose it and start building your
14:25
brand further and then it's kind of like
14:27
you know kill two versions one stone
14:29
they're also going out and promoting it
14:30
so you get content and you get promotion
14:32
of your product um and then third right
14:34
is paid marketing
14:36
um you know we love paid search because
14:39
when somebody's searching for Google for
14:42
a Bryce young t-shirt right they are
14:44
really looking for that specific item so
14:48
um there's there's very high level of
14:50
intent right people are looking for
14:52
these items whereas social media you're
14:54
trying to just get more products in
14:55
front of them based on interest or based
14:57
on different demographics and so we
14:59
found that page search on Google has
15:02
been highly effective and then lastly
15:04
get into these marketplaces right that's
15:06
free marketing meaning if you can get
15:09
your product on Etsy get it on Etsy if
15:11
you can get it on Google shopping get it
15:12
on Google shopping right these
15:14
marketplaces go a long way because you
15:17
know I found that a lot of people now
15:19
out they just go to they click on
15:21
shopping when they Google something and
15:23
they're looking for products to purchase
15:24
they're literally clicking on that
15:26
shopping tab so that it Aggregates all
15:28
the sites that Google might be connected
15:29
to on the shopping side
3 required skills for entrepreneurship
15:35
hi Karthik what would you say are the
15:38
most important skills to building a
15:41
business like yours yeah so I think uh
15:44
first being remote right communication
15:46
is so key that's the speed of
15:49
communication the quality communication
15:50
the clarity I think communication is
15:53
just a huge undertaking and there's
15:55
different forms of communication right
15:56
written verbal uh even recording videos
15:59
and sharing it with your team creating
16:01
that kind of asynchronous Harmony within
16:03
the company where you don't have to meet
16:05
to you know figure out these issues
16:07
right I think is what has really led us
16:09
to be successful on the internal side
16:11
and then externally right how you're
16:13
communicating with customers and clients
16:15
that's really really key so I'd say
16:17
communication is very top there written
16:19
verbal and just even yeah recording
16:21
videos I would say is its own form
16:24
um then number two is like the ability
16:26
to learn anything or teach yourself
16:27
something right there's so many
16:29
resources online you know everything is
16:32
a Google search away from you learning
16:34
it on your own and oftentimes you know I
16:36
think even I see it in our employees
16:38
where they'll get stuck on a problem and
16:41
I'll they'll come to me and I I don't
16:42
know the answer to the problem what do I
16:44
do I go to Google and I search it right
16:46
so trying to get in that mindset where
16:48
there is always an answer out there for
16:50
your problems and then third I think
16:53
surrounding yourself with either a good
16:55
co-founder and or advisor right or
16:58
mentors that have done it before and
17:00
have been in your position right but
17:03
also they can be very blunt with you and
17:05
very critique it so I don't know if it's
17:08
necessarily as much of a skill or as a
17:10
tactic right is getting and hiring good
17:13
people around you whether it be advisors
17:15
co-founders employees I think really
17:17
getting that skill down is really really
17:20
important
17:21
um and just kind of getting getting it
17:22
getting a good team under under you or
17:24
behind you is is really really important
How to start a business
17:26
what advice would you have for someone
17:28
who's just starting a Shopify or
17:30
e-commerce or anything in the retail and
17:33
Merchandising space yeah so I think the
17:35
first is like just get started I think
17:38
like a lot of people overthink how and
17:41
when or what to do do to get started
17:43
whether it's writing up a business
17:44
planning strategy right and I'm not
17:46
saying go right at 50 page business plan
17:48
but develop parts of a business plan and
17:50
then start implementing some of that
17:51
right away you're going to learn more on
17:53
the job than you will uh just kind of
17:55
reading stuff and articles online and
17:57
then lastly I'd say humility right and
18:00
just making sure like you don't know
18:02
everything and kind of having that
18:03
learning mindset and that just really
18:05
wanting to engulf yourself in the
18:07
industry or market and learning from the
18:09
ground up I think that's a really
18:12
key aspect of Entrepreneurship is just
18:15
having that intellectual or that that
18:16
genuine curiosity I think is really key
18:19
to success as an entrepreneur


Title: I Built a $1M AI App [No Code]
Show: Starter Story
Aired: Feb 11, 2024
Episode Description: This is the breakdown of how David Bressler went from working a full-time job to building an AI app valued at over $1M in just over 1 year.
Transcript:
0:00
this is David he built an AI app that is
0:03
now valued at over a million dollar and
0:06
the crazy part is he built it all with
0:08
no code he invit us into his house to
0:10
show us exactly how he built this thing
0:12
with a family a full-time job and just
0:15
working a couple hours a day really took
0:17
me just a couple weeks came down to
0:20
learning all of this content mostly
0:21
through YouTube David launched his
0:23
product using a viral marketing strategy
0:25
that got him thousands of users in just
0:28
a few days but
0:30
what goes up must come down I blew
0:33
through like $5,000 in days I had a
0:37
decision to make right it's either shut
0:39
it down or keep going in this video he
0:41
breaks down how he bounced back how he
0:43
made his first dollar and how he plans
0:45
to build a business that won't be
0:47
replaced by chat gbt my vision moving
0:50
forward is to build something that
0:52
cannot be replicated both in chat gbt as
0:55
well as Microsoft this is the breakdown
0:57
on how a normal guy turned one idea into
0:59
a a million-- dooll business on just a
1:01
few hours a day I'm Pat walls and this
1:04
is starter
1:07
story David thanks for having me thanks
Who is David
1:09
for coming on ever I love your story
1:11
tell me a little about who you are and
1:13
what you built sure daveid brusser built
1:15
what was called XL for real bot now it's
1:18
just called for real bot Microsoft gave
1:20
me a uh season doist a few months ago or
1:23
so and so it's a software that really
1:25
helps people work faster and smarter
1:27
with data there's really three main
1:30
products Ai and spreadsheets it's col
1:32
like chat GPT inside both Excel and
1:35
Google Sheets for whe generators that
1:37
translates text into formulas with the
1:39
help of AI and then the last product
1:41
where a lot of my time and resources
1:42
have g into is called the data analyzer
1:45
where it's kind of like zappier you can
1:47
upload your data and then through
1:48
natural language get answers analysis
1:52
charts modeling all done by just typing
1:54
in some words the application has been
1:57
around for about a year and a half and
1:58
during that time there's now roughly
2:01
about 750,000 users and of those 750k
2:05
there's about 5,000 people that pay for
2:08
unlimited access to Tool and during that
2:10
time it's has reached about $226,000 a
2:13
monthly recr as I understand you started
How he started Formula Bot
2:16
formula bot while you had a full-time
2:17
job tell me a little bit more about that
2:19
story it was July of uh 2022 I had this
2:24
opportunity and the opportunity was my
2:26
youngest one was about to be born and so
2:28
I knew I was going to have about 6 weeks
2:30
to to do something and I've been working
2:32
a full-time job since I graduated
2:34
college 2011 and I've always kind of had
2:36
that entrepreneurial neck basically said
2:38
okay I've got 6 weeks let's build
2:40
something people always say scratch your
2:42
own itch right solve your own problem
2:44
and my problem was I I was getting so
2:47
bogg down with all of these Junior adal
2:50
they come knocking on my office door
2:52
like hey can you help me with this for
2:53
me can you help me with that I kind of
2:55
thought okay my itch is helping people
2:57
with Excel while chat gbt wasn't around
3:00
then the actual technology was I
3:03
actually asked the open AI uh
3:06
application I said hey I'm thinking
3:08
about building this app what's a good
3:10
name for it and uh one of the names I
3:12
suggested uh was Excel formula do thing
3:15
you do of course is you go to go daddy
3:18
it was available and then I was like let
3:20
me just see if someone's built this yet
3:22
and I scour the internet for hours
3:25
couldn't find it I'm like this is it I'm
3:27
on the something special it was tough
3:29
try to find that balance between
3:31
personal life you know I I can't help
3:33
but to a certain extent stay on the grid
3:36
for my full-time job especially in the
3:38
senior position that I was in and so
3:40
while I wasn't working I still had
3:42
access to my phone people were still
3:44
asking me questions here and there but
3:46
then in the back of my mind I'm like
3:47
I've got this idea that I have to
3:49
execute out I tried to spend as much
3:51
time with the family especially early on
3:53
but I couldn't have book time myself
3:55
kind of stepping away for a little bit
3:57
go to coffee shops wh it might be and
3:59
just kind of put my head down and
4:00
execute and uh there were definitely a
4:02
lot of nights where I only got a couple
4:04
hours of sleep my wife at that time
4:06
thought I was crazy uh especially
4:08
because I I didn't really have a clear
4:10
path I just know wanted to build this
4:12
thing so from what I understand you have
How he launched Formula Bot
4:14
no experience coding how did you build
4:16
and launch something like this I'm not a
4:18
coder by any means if I see it I kind of
4:21
know okay that's JavaScript that's HTML
4:23
and I knew for what I wanted to build as
4:26
an MVP it would take a pretty
4:28
significant time to build it with code
4:31
and I at that time wasn't making any
4:32
money I didn't want to hire anyone
4:35
because I just had an idea and so that's
4:37
for where I was really exposed to uh the
4:40
the no code industry I was exposed to
4:42
bubble.io that was really the only
4:45
application that I really dove into to
4:47
to build cuz it was the most well-known
4:49
and based on the research that I had
4:51
done that the easiest of all the not
4:53
code Solutions the first place I went
4:55
was the bubble official website for just
4:58
kind of reading some documentation
5:00
but there's so much documentation out
5:02
there which is a good thing kind of
5:03
where I got hung up was very isolated
5:06
issues that I was TR Sol but that's
5:08
really where YouTube University came in
5:10
there are some awesome bubble developers
5:13
out there that produce such high quality
5:15
content on YouTube and it's all free at
5:18
that time the whole app was in bubble it
5:20
was 100% no code probably up until maybe
5:23
four or 5 months ago it went from 100%
5:26
no Cove to now it's about I would say
5:29
like 5 or 10% as you get more experience
5:32
with no code you start to understand
5:34
some of the limitations there's not a
5:35
lot but there are some limitations David
5:38
is the perfect example of how someone
5:40
with zero experience turned one idea
5:42
into hundreds of thousands of dollars
5:44
but that comes with knowing the right
5:46
information and finding the right
5:48
problems to solve now imagine there's a
5:50
place that gave you all this the
5:52
problems to solve the blueprints to
5:54
solve them and the strategies that turn
5:56
simple ideas into million-dollar
5:58
businesses well at start story we have a
6:00
library of over 4,000 case studies and
6:02
business idea breakdowns where you can
6:04
access this all backed by data from real
6:07
entrepreneurs so if you're serious about
6:09
building a profitable side project and
6:11
joining a tight-knit community of
6:12
Founders head to the first link in the
6:14
description and we're going to give you
6:16
52 micro SAS ideas just like David's so
6:19
you can get started on your journey much
6:21
love enjoy the rest of the video peace
6:23
all right so you have this MVP that you
How he got his first customer
6:25
built from scratch how do you get your
6:27
first customer and how do you get a ton
6:29
of people to use it the first people I
6:30
told were the people that were at my
6:32
full-time job at that time and they're
6:34
like oh my God this is amazing they
6:36
thought it took me months to build this
6:37
thing really took me just a couple weeks
6:40
and then that really kind of speaks to
6:42
the power of no code um because if you
6:44
were to code it it would take much
6:45
longer and so my next step was I need to
6:48
tell more people about this tool and so
6:51
naturally the next place I want was
6:53
Reddit went to the XL subreddit where
6:56
there's probably several hundred people
6:58
that follow it RIT title was AI XL
7:01
formula generator and I think I
7:03
mentioned it was free and it was just a
7:05
title and the description was just the
7:07
link minutes later it was like the top
7:10
post of the day turned into the top post
7:12
of the week it blew up as much as like
7:15
something can blow up within the Excel
7:17
Community a couple of days after that
7:20
someone in the CET section said you
7:22
should post this on the Internet is
7:24
beautiful subreddit and so I posted it
7:26
there that was like the thing that put
7:28
the app over for the edge and made it go
7:31
viral for months and so I had posted
7:33
there it got some 10,000 up votes
7:37
thousands of comments yeah I got
7:39
thousands and thousands of people
7:41
visiting the site using the app all
7:43
right so you have thousands of users how
How he started making money
7:45
do you start making actual money from
7:47
this the next thing I did was want's the
7:49
open AI website what's the billing
7:52
section it just like oh
7:55
God I I blew through like $5,000 and
7:59
open AI API costs in days I had a
8:04
decision to make right it's either shut
8:06
it down or keep going and so I acre this
8:09
huge bill over that time I recouped some
8:12
of it back I put up a link like a stripe
8:15
link where it's just like hey my name's
8:17
David I built this app it went viral
8:19
give me Z feel free to donate so I made
8:22
a few ,000 back I was super Scrappy of
8:26
like trying to make something back at
8:28
that time it was pretty poetic
8:30
especially probably at its peak of
8:33
virality the host from the um esorts
8:38
ESPN XL competition I didn't say it
8:41
correct for good something like that but
8:42
it's basically like extreme sports but
8:45
it's for Excel the host reached out to
8:47
me and said hey we have our competition
8:50
on on ESPN in a couple of weeks can we
8:53
run a beta ad I'm like sure I'm like and
8:56
at that time I was like maybe that's how
8:58
I before even thought about
8:59
subscriptions I'm like maybe that's how
9:01
I can make money at least in the interim
9:03
is just running ads so I ran some Google
9:05
ads made a few bucks here and there it
9:07
just it definitely wasn't worth the
9:09
hassle but I I ran an ad for ESPN for
9:12
like a week and it drove a ton of clicks
9:15
and it was actually pretty funny because
9:17
the guy asked me to design the creative
9:20
I'm like look dude like you've seen the
9:22
website especially at that time it was a
9:24
single page piece of crap it wasn't
9:26
crave at all but I I locked something up
9:28
for he said okay works for me and so
9:31
some of the donations that came in a
9:34
couple of sponsorships it it gave me the
9:36
motivation to kind of keep going and not
9:39
just completely shut this thing down and
9:41
so then a few months later launch with a
9:44
pay wall logins and the whole nine yards
9:47
let's talk about product talking to
Product talking to customers
9:49
customers how you figured out what
9:50
features to build early on just kind of
9:53
scratch my own itch and what would bring
9:55
me value and what started off as just a
9:57
XL formula generator turned into
10:00
different generators that was really
10:02
just the first product it was actually
10:04
interesting because at that time my site
10:06
was blowing up and I I I took a few
10:09
phone calls with VCS they would ask me
10:12
you know what's your vision what's your
10:13
broader vision and I would just say more
10:16
generators and they're like okay I never
10:18
got called back I didn't have a broader
10:21
Vision that's where I started talking to
10:23
people that I work with who it's
10:25
required to work with data in
10:27
spreadsheets started asking asking them
10:29
and see what they liked what they didn't
10:31
like but occasionally and and this is
10:34
where I think I would get the most value
10:36
talking with customers a lot of them
10:39
email me basic Excel questions that
10:42
couldn't necessarily be answered through
10:44
an Excel formula generator they would
10:46
literally email me their Excel files
10:48
they're like hey your Excel formula
10:50
generator couldn't do this can you help
10:52
me with this and it wasn't even to like
10:54
build a formula it was to like build a
10:56
report where I have no domain knowledge
10:58
of of of what they're trying to
11:00
accomplish I would probably get one
11:02
email a week of someone just sending me
11:04
a file and so I thought okay you know
11:07
what even if they're not a paying
11:08
customer I'm going to take this but
11:10
guess what I'm going to do it with you
11:12
on a phone call and I'll do your work
11:14
for you but every time I do it they have
11:16
to hop on a call at me and they have to
11:18
ask questions about what they like and
11:20
what they don't like about the product
11:21
as well as some ideas that they have and
11:23
so the culmination of kind of scratching
11:25
my own itch leading on my network and
11:28
having these kind of impromptu phone
11:30
calls kind of revolutionized the product
11:32
away from just being an XL formula
11:34
generator to just kind of being this
11:36
all-in platform for anything that you do
11:38
with data analytics building a SAS
Competitors
11:40
product software product there's
11:41
probably going to be a lot of
11:42
competitors coming in tell me about how
11:44
that works product took me a few weeks
11:46
to build this app and a few weeks after
11:49
that I think there was probably 10 other
11:52
EXCEL formula generator sites and the
11:55
frustrating part was they all sounded
11:57
the same right at that time Excel
12:00
formula bot Excel formula generator
12:02
another one was called Excel formulator
12:05
they all sounded the same and when you'd
12:07
go to Google and you'd search mine you'd
12:09
see the other couple ones right there so
12:11
at that point it was really a Ras to the
12:13
bottom and my prices especially early on
12:15
it was $3 I was getting pretty
12:17
frustrated just all of the competition
12:19
that was coming in and literally like
12:21
carbon copying my exact application not
12:24
only like what it does but also the
12:26
front end the name and then I just kind
12:29
of reached the point where I knew I was
12:32
going to have to build something that
12:34
isn't just a simple input output box few
12:37
months later EXL for bot was was getting
12:40
more and more popularity Microsoft
12:43
actually reached out to me they reached
12:44
out to me twice one for a Seas business
12:47
and the other one it was someone that
12:49
was on their add-ons team Excel has you
12:51
know thousands and thousands of partners
12:53
that they work with to build an add-on
12:55
that supplements what you can do with
12:57
Excel they reached out to me and said
12:58
hey we want to take your XL formula bot
13:01
and add it within our add-on store let
13:04
us build it for you I was like sure how
13:06
much does it cost they're like we'll do
13:07
it for free I'm like this is awesome and
13:10
then as they were building it I was like
13:13
wait a second they're just going to
13:15
hijack this idea and build it as one of
13:18
the many features in their in their
13:20
Suite couple weeks after that they had
13:23
announced their partnership with open AI
13:25
everyone's so excited for AI being
13:28
integrated in the office suite and I'm
13:30
like I am so crude and so that's where
13:35
kind of went back to me being my own
13:37
competition where I had to really take a
13:40
step back and think through what is this
13:43
product going to be once Microsoft
13:45
embeds this product within their Suite
13:48
have even talked about chat GPT chat GPT
13:51
especially at this time as well it was
13:53
free and it it still is free for
13:56
unlimited usage at that time you had to
13:58
paid $299 now you got to pay $9 it's got
14:01
to work its way up $299 to $699 to $9
14:06
and you have to pay for unlimited usage
14:09
whereas chat GPT has always been free
14:11
and so I have about 5% CH 10% of the
14:15
reason why people CH is because of chat
14:17
GPT and so early on before a lot of the
14:21
newer products especially the the data
14:24
analyzer where you can upload your data
14:26
and to with it the competitive Advantage
14:28
I had over chat GPT was really
14:30
convenience generate formulas within
14:33
Excel you don't have to leave your
14:34
spreadsheets you don't have to open up
14:36
your browser you don't have to open up
14:38
chat gbt and write list long prompt you
14:40
can do it all there convenience and
14:43
customization when you sign up you can
14:45
put in your language your speaking
14:47
language you can put in your language
14:49
for what you prefer for Excel because
14:51
there's a lot of people out there that
14:52
speak in in Spanish but they prefer the
14:55
Spanish version of Excel and then also
14:57
vice versa again Excel it's used by a
14:59
billion people in the world Excel for
15:01
laot is used by every single country and
15:04
thousands of languishes so early on it
15:06
really was convenience and customization
15:09
but that can only take you so far and so
15:11
more so recently with the addition of
15:14
the new features and new products it's
15:16
moved from that to you can no longer do
15:19
that in chat GPT and eventually when
15:22
Microsoft really just this past week
15:24
builds AI into their own tool right now
15:27
my vision moving for Bo is to build
15:29
something that cannot be replicated both
15:31
in chat gbt as well as Microsoft hey Pat

Transcript:
0:00
hi David what's your
0:03
story I was working from my parents
0:06
house in the bedroom day and night I had
0:09
no money and it was time to really it
0:11
was time to Make It or Break It this is
0:13
David Park and for years he tried
0:16
everything to make money I started my
0:18
first company when I was 16 I'm 27 now
0:21
that's a decade of failing then one day
0:24
he came across an idea that would change
0:26
his life forever but at the beginning
0:30
things weren't looking so bright a cold
0:32
called every single Agency for 8 hours a
0:34
day for weeks and weeks and weeks they
0:36
hang up on you reject you literally
0:38
probably 99% of the time but when
0:40
everything was at its worst David
0:42
experienced a miracle suddenly we get a
0:45
huge wave of users when we're getting to
0:48
50 60 80,000
0:52
Mr then I got a cancer diagnosis and it
0:55
felt like my dreams and nightmares were
0:57
happening at the same time this is the
0:59
story of how David Park built an AI app
1:01
to a $25 million valuation in Just 2
1:05
years I'm Pat walls and this is starter
1:11
story David grew up in a family of
1:14
entrepreneurs and even though they never
1:16
had a lot of money he still had a dream
1:18
that he could be one too when I was in
1:21
seventh grade I thought you know man
1:23
it'd be so cool if like I'm a founder
1:25
and it'd be so cool if I can build stuff
1:27
and so when I was 16 I actually made my
1:29
first company was like a clothing brand
1:31
obviously it failed spectacularly David
1:33
experienced his first failure early on
1:36
and like all protective parents they
1:38
sacrificed everything they had to send
1:40
him off to a college in hopes for a
1:42
better life my parents gave me $20,000
1:45
they said you know you go to college
1:46
you're going to have a better life than
1:48
us you're going to go be a lawyer doctor
1:50
the sad thing is I kind of felt like I
1:52
didn't really fit in anywhere I didn't
1:53
really feel it fit in in my fraternity I
1:56
didn't really feel it fit in with like
1:57
the people in my major I was always
1:58
surrounded by people but I always felt
2:00
like a little bit lonely which is kind
2:02
of sad David was facing a dilemma he was
2:05
an entrepreneur at heart but he was
2:08
trapped in an environment that didn't
2:09
make him happy so we made a huge
2:12
decision he decided to drop out and
2:14
Chase his dreams of starting a startup
2:16
and luckily along the way he meets
2:19
someone just as weird and passionate as
2:21
him his eventual business partner and
2:23
co-founder Henry he loved AI I loved
2:25
writing we always try to find some way
2:27
to make it work the sum total of failed
2:28
STS that we did together was probably n
2:30
or 10 which is pretty nuts eventually we
2:33
stumbled upon gpt2 we asked it to tell
2:35
us a story gpt2 spit out this line that
2:38
said nothing is darker than a butthole
2:41
and and obviously as two people enamored
2:44
with this Tech we were raving we're like
2:46
this is the funniest line ever also it's
2:50
profound that butthole sentence
2:52
convinced us two but holes to create
2:54
Jenny all right so this is a quick
2:56
product uh video for Jenny the boys had
2:58
found their idea and and now the
3:00
business was in motion Henry would do
3:02
the coding and David would do the
3:04
selling their goal was simple create a
3:07
product to help agencies write better
3:09
content with the help of AI and their
3:11
next goal was to make their first dollar
3:14
that was like a terrible painful time of
3:17
uh cold calls obviously nobody wants to
3:19
talk with you they hang up on you reject
3:21
you you have to get used to getting
3:22
rejected so I was working from my
3:25
parents house just in the bedroom it was
3:28
pretty sad my mom she would wake up and
3:31
then she'd hear me just like raving to
3:33
some poor soul about why they need to
3:36
invest in us or they need to buy us and
3:38
then she'd go before she'd go to sleep
3:39
she'd still hear me kind of speaking to
3:42
some other poor fellow so I like pretty
3:44
much just working uh day and night the
3:46
worst part was like Korean moms will
3:48
just get together and just talk about
3:50
their kids like their trading cards like
3:51
my kid is now a level two Amazon
3:54
engineer my kid is now doing their
3:55
masters at Stanford and then it would
3:57
get to my mom's turn and she would just
3:59
say oh my son is working on a startup
4:01
the most humilating thing was I had to
4:03
ask my mom for her card if I wanted to
4:05
get Chipotle cuz I just had like no
4:07
money I was a real loser but my parents
4:09
were so kind to me like they never made
4:11
me feel like a loser like they would
4:13
always um they would always give me food
4:15
and they never make me feel bad about
4:19
um
4:28
uh
4:34
they never they
4:36
never
4:38
[Music]
4:39
uh so they never make me feel bad about
4:41
anything they just always like there was
4:42
always just food on the table on days
4:44
that I didn't believe in myself I felt
4:45
like my parents believed in me my
4:46
co-founder would believe in me my
4:48
friends obviously believed in me so it
4:49
was painful but I guess I'm glad that I
4:51
went through them
4:55
yeah in 2020 GPT 3 came out David is is
4:59
getting some traction thanks to a wave
5:01
of businesses wanting to get their hands
5:03
on AI they're getting users but
5:05
eventually they hit a plateau they try
5:08
everything but they can't get past
5:10
$2,000 a month in Revenue then David
5:14
learns and implements something that
5:16
would change his business forever it
5:18
really came down to the boring stuff of
5:20
just talk to your users ask the more
5:22
difficult questions you know you
5:23
shouldn't be asking why do you like my
5:25
product you should be asking why do you
5:27
dislike my product like what what what
5:29
do you love about other people's
5:31
products the focal point of I feel like
5:32
many Founders they talk to users is like
5:33
they make it about themselves and their
5:35
product when it should really be about
5:36
the users tell me about your current
5:38
workflow how does Jenny fit into it what
5:40
exactly do you do with Jenny or like can
5:42
you share your screen and can we write
5:43
an article together these insights are
5:45
really important we realized that people
5:47
wanted to have a friendly AI assisted
5:50
writing journey and so when we pulled
5:51
out everything that was when we really
5:53
started to grow after months of talking
5:55
to customers and refining the product
5:57
they start to find a new audio for Jenny
6:01
but at this point David basically has 0
6:04
left in his bank account he's exhausted
6:07
all of his options but he decides to try
6:09
one more thing he agrees to go on a
6:12
random podcast to talk about his startup
6:14
Journey it doesn't have that many
6:16
listeners but luckily one Scout for
6:19
Jason calanus happened to listen to the
6:20
podcast the craziest Miracle ever cuz
6:22
like it was not viewed by many people
6:24
and so I got a $100,000 check from Jason
6:27
like I said I was living off Shin Ramen
6:28
and you know whatever my parents put out
6:30
on the dinner table so $100,000 was so
6:36
crazy the first thing we do is my
6:38
co-founder and I we book a flight to
6:39
Malaysia because at the very least it'll
6:42
cut down our Burn by 1/4th we basically
6:44
just want to extend our Runway because
6:45
we kind of didn't trust ourselves with
6:47
the money it was a crazy moment getting
6:49
the check but I didn't feel successful
6:51
at all because now the real job of
6:54
getting my hands dirty was actually
6:55
getting started I kind of raved earlier
6:57
about like how much I love my family but
6:59
um I was alone by myself it was very
7:01
productive but it was very lonely it was
7:04
tough it was it was character building I
7:06
would say I had 100K check I was
7:08
completely by myself it was time to Make
7:10
It or Break It Now the real dirty work
7:12
had begun with a bit of funding and a
7:15
tiny Runway David and his co-founder
7:17
spent the next several months iterating
7:19
and building Jenny into a completely new
7:22
product talking to customers documenting
7:24
the progress and trying just about
7:26
anything to increase Revenue then one
7:30
night something incredible happens
7:33
suddenly we get a huge wave of users
7:36
every minute I refresh the page I think
7:38
we would get tens of us new users every
7:40
minute that I refresh the page a guy
7:42
named Zay Khan posted a Twitter thread
7:44
that became one of the most viral
7:46
Twitter threads in history and we were
7:47
actually included in that thread from
7:50
there we went from like 2,000 to 10,000
7:52
Mr in one month that's when I felt the
7:55
first semblance of success Jenny AI was
7:57
growing at a rapid Pace in David felt
7:59
like he was on top of the world but
8:02
there was still a problem virality comes
8:04
and goes it's not something David could
8:06
rely on to build a great business so the
8:08
very next thing I wanted to do was kind
8:09
of figure that out for ourselves I
8:11
brought on one of my college buddies
8:13
actually to help us with Tik Tok and
8:15
Instagram reals All That Jazz and then
8:16
we experienced our second wave of
8:18
virality we understood the power of
8:19
social media we continue to kind of push
8:22
on with uh viral marketing when we were
8:24
getting to 50 60 880,000 Mr you know now
8:28
it was kind of happening where I think
8:29
at that point we were close to like a
8:30
million a year from where we started
8:32
that was like so crazy to us and I felt
8:34
like man we could push this so much
8:36
further we could go so much farther but
8:38
then I got a cancer diagnosis and it
8:40
felt like my dreams and nightmares were
8:42
happening at the same time the the most
8:44
worrying thing for me though is that it
8:46
would put me out of commission and there
8:48
was a chance that my voice would be
8:51
damaged I remember the surgery because
8:53
of the fever they had to reschedule me
8:55
which made my sleep deprivation food
8:57
deprivation all that even worse it
8:59
prolonged my pain more but one thing
9:01
that helped was my mom told me that
9:02
there's something I I'll tell you before
9:04
your surgery and don't worry it's going
9:06
to give you all the strength you need
9:07
you're not even going to be nervous
9:08
everything's going to be fine and then
9:09
so for some reason my mom went to the
9:11
bathroom or something while I was taking
9:12
a nap and like the nurses run in and
9:13
they're like because of your fever
9:15
complication we have to do surgery right
9:17
now I don't even speak Korean to be
9:19
signing documents like can we wait for
9:20
my mom and then they're like we just got
9:22
to run it now and I was honestly
9:24
thinking about like man I got a crazy
9:25
startup right now I can just bolt out of
9:27
here thyroid cancer moves kind of slow
9:29
like it's not like the craziest risk I
9:30
could take but I remember on the ceiling
9:32
there was a Bible verse it said like
9:34
leave everything to God I was like all
9:36
right well I'll leave it up to the big
9:38
man upstairs like I I I have to get the
9:40
surgery so I'll just stay I don't know
9:42
what I just signed my mom's not here
9:44
it's fine I'll just stay the surgery
9:46
went well I was able to not speak for a
9:47
little bit but I was able to get my
9:49
voice back few days after the surgery I
9:51
was like hey Mom like what was that
9:53
thing you wanted to tell me before the
9:54
surgery she told me oh it's just it's
9:55
dumb it was just this one Bible verse
9:57
that I really liked and it happened to
9:58
be the same Bible verse that was on the
10:00
ceiling which is pretty crazy to me
10:02
where I take it as is like Miracle what
10:04
an awesome little blessing that I got I
10:07
had to read that somebody had to tell me
10:08
that and my mom was in the bathroom so I
10:10
didn't get she didn't get to read it to
10:11
me but thankfully that painter put it up
10:13
there for me so I got to read it after
10:14
the surgery I was obviously very
10:16
emotional I was very moved by the love
10:19
that I received from like my family and
10:21
my girlfriend and I thought the limited
10:24
time I have left was like my family my
10:27
grandparents all that stuff but instead
10:28
I'm I'm spending so much time on my
10:30
startup like so much time
10:33
so I actually shopped Jenny to like if
10:37
people would be open to acquiring Jenny
10:39
at that point David was facing a wave of
10:42
problems after his surgery he realized
10:44
that the business was unstable without
10:46
him leading the pack after seeing no
10:48
growth when he was out with cancer David
10:51
also realized Jenny did not have product
10:54
Market fit so he had a tough choice to
10:56
make either Cash Out grab a quick quick
10:59
few million bucks and start freshh or
11:02
double down find ways to fix the
11:04
business find product Market fit and
11:07
take things to a whole another level it
11:10
just didn't feel right to like throw my
11:12
cards in early you know it wasn't like a
11:14
triumphant I will not sell this will
11:16
it's sort of like I don't know if this
11:17
is the right decision but it just feels
11:18
right in my gut that one hard decision I
11:20
made I'm very proud of myself from then
11:22
I focus on hiring people on the
11:23
marketing growth side and we went into
11:25
more scaling mode I would say up to the
11:27
1 millon we're doing a lot of exploring
11:28
trying out a bunch of zany ideas a bunch
11:30
of paths and then from 1 to three we
11:33
really started heavily deploying capital
11:35
in the ones that were successful
11:36
tactically what I would do is I would
11:38
basically start a Tik Tok account try a
11:40
bunch of different creative formats and
11:42
then find one format that works and
11:43
somehow turn that into a series and then
11:45
start multiplying your accounts so you
11:47
could have multiple creators you're
11:48
basically paying creators like some
11:50
baseline monthly salary and you're
11:52
giving them some incentives where like
11:53
if your videos get X many views or if
11:56
you get y conversions then you get you
11:58
know even more money per month you
12:00
should basically just think about how
12:02
can you scale the content I think that's
12:03
like the big question you should
12:07
ask I started my first company when I
12:09
was 16 I'm 27 now that's a decade of
12:13
failing I really only got any semblance
12:15
sucess in the last 18 months so it's 9
12:17
years almost a decade of just gut
12:19
punches people not taking you seriously
12:21
you need that discipline I think if you
12:23
really care about your dream and if you
12:25
really care about making something that
12:27
is used by millions of people then you
12:29
can't give it like a onewe shot you
12:31
can't you can't even give it a year shot
12:33
you have to really put your all into it
12:35
sacrifice everything for many many years
12:38
and then you have a shot you have maybe
12:39
a chance at success but even if you put
12:41
your all into it there's a chance that
12:43
you will fail if you still make a
12:45
startup and if you still try despite
12:46
knowing that you could have nothing and
12:48
you could lose everything then that must
12:49
mean that you really care about what
12:50
you're building and you really care
12:51
about making better life for yourself
12:54
your family your users we talked about
12:56
quitting earlier had I sold then which
12:57
was earlier this year it was only like 6
12:59
7 months ago you know it would have been
13:01
such a terrible decision for me to sell
13:03
at that point because went from selling
13:05
to 3 million now we're at 3 million AR
13:07
we're above 3 million AR the true worth
13:09
of our startup now is probably like 10
13:11
to 30 million you know it's like it's
13:13
like way more than what I would have
13:14
sold for then within 6 months we more
13:16
than doubled our business yeah
13:18
persistence is quite important I would
13:20
say hey Pat from starter story here

this guy is the highest paid solopreneur
0:02
on the internet meet Brett Williams a
0:05
dude who went from working a normal job
0:06
to making over $2 million a year with a
0:08
side project he has zero employees zero
0:12
contractors and only works 6 hours a day
0:14
when I first came across his story I
0:16
thought he might be lying but then I did
0:18
some more digging studied his business
0:20
and even flew out to Arizona to meet him
0:22
in person what I learned blew my mind
0:25
Brett's nearly $2 million business is no
0:28
accident it has nothing to do with luck
0:30
but rather some very smart decisions he
0:32
made while building his business and
0:34
today in less than 12 minutes I'm going
0:36
to break down the five key steps that
0:38
took Brett from an average business idea
0:40
to a $1.8 million Pere solopreneur
0:43
welcome to the
0:51
Playbook so Brett starts out like any
0:53
normal guy working in average 9 to5 for
0:56
years he's a graphic designer working on
0:58
landing pages logo brand designs simple
1:01
work that pays the bills but like any
1:04
aspiring entrepreneur deep down he's
1:06
thirsty for something more something he
1:08
can truly own then one day everything
1:11
changes when he comes across a peculiar
1:14
website it's a subscription service
1:16
offering quote unlimited graphic design
1:18
for businesses instead of charging by
1:20
the project or by the hour this agency
1:23
charges a recurring flat subscription
1:25
fee for unlimited graphic designs and by
1:28
the looks of it they're doing really
1:29
well well they even have a brick and
1:31
mortar location with a few employees and
1:33
this is the moment that Brett gets his
1:35
business idea he decides he'll do the
1:37
same thing he'll start his own agency
1:40
but instead of getting on sales calls
1:41
with clients they can just purchase his
1:43
Services directly on his website but
1:46
most importantly instead of building a
1:47
whole team he'll just do it himself as a
1:49
side project to earn a little extra
1:51
income 12 hours and $29 later Brett puts
1:55
up a simple landing page and calls it
1:58
design joy and within 24 hours he gets
2:01
his first paying client that's pretty
2:03
fast right well that's the first key
2:05
step in Brett's genius Playbook step
2:08
number one demand-based
2:12
pricing the hardest thing to do in
2:14
business is get your first paying
2:16
customer for most people it takes months
2:18
to finally get that one person to hand
2:21
their money over to you and honestly
2:23
most people quit before they even get
2:25
their first customer but Brett skips
2:27
this whole problem by making one key
2:29
decision he grossly undercharges for his
2:33
service see when he throws up that
2:35
landing page he sets his price at
2:38
$449 a month Yes you heard that right
2:41
unlimited design requests for $449 bucks
2:45
this price is too good to be true but
2:47
guess what it gets him his first
2:49
customer in less than 24 hours and
2:52
that's the genius behind it of course
2:55
this business is not scalable at that
2:57
price point but Brett understands the
2:59
power of speed and momentum when you're
3:01
starting a business instead of waiting
3:03
around for months for someone to pay him
3:05
$5,000 a month he just throws himself
3:07
into the fire and this is where Brett
3:09
succeeds where most others fail he's
3:12
willing to put his ego aside so he can
3:14
put in thousands of reps even though
3:16
he's basically working for free and
3:18
these reps are the ones that eventually
3:20
turn Brett into a worldclass designer
3:23
his Niche starts to notice and then his
3:25
Services become more in demand and when
3:27
the demand increases he raises his
3:30
prices he goes from $449 to $1,000 a
3:34
month then to $3,000 a month then to
3:37
$5,000 a month and now he even charges
3:40
$88,000 a month per client today he only
3:44
needs 16 clients paying $55,000 a month
3:47
to make about a million do a year and
3:50
this is all because he was willing to
3:52
undercharge for his service and willing
3:55
to do the work and that brings us to
3:57
step two of The Playbook B
4:00
[Music]
4:01
boundaries so at this point Brett's put
4:03
in the Reps he's raising his prices and
4:06
now he has customers coming out of his
4:08
ears but this is actually a problem
4:10
because Brett is a one-man band he finds
4:13
himself working 16-hour days on the
4:15
verge of burnout the solution hire more
4:18
people right but Brett doesn't want to
4:20
hire people he wants to be a solopreneur
4:22
so he comes up with a creative solution
4:24
he decides to break the rules by
4:26
creating two boundaries number one
4:29
clients must submit design requests
4:32
asynchronously via a trell board and
4:35
number two clients can only have one
4:38
design request at a time no calls no
4:41
meetings all client requests must be
4:44
defined in writing and once the client
4:45
has submitted an active request they're
4:48
not allowed to change it or submit
4:49
another one this gives Brett a few days
4:51
to deliver the work and once completed
4:54
then the client can submit another
4:55
request because of this clients spend
4:58
more time making sure their requests are
5:00
fully fleshed out and complete which
5:02
actually leads them to sending less
5:04
requests and it saves both of them
5:07
countless hours of meetings this is what
5:09
I call boundaries he doesn't do this
5:12
because he's an he does it
5:14
because he has to Brett creates these
5:16
boundaries to protect his precious time
5:18
so that he can spend his time doing the
5:20
thing he loves creating designs without
5:23
these boundaries he wouldn't be able to
5:24
make over a million dollars with zero
5:26
employees and he'd probably lose his
5:28
sanity and completely burn out I imagine
5:31
some clients don't like these boundaries
5:33
but that's fine there are many that
5:35
actually do and those are the ones that
5:37
he works with and that brings us to the
5:39
next key move in Brett's Playbook step
5:42
number three the $500
5:45
client there are two types of clients
5:48
$500 clients and $5,000 clients $500
5:52
clients are cheap they'll waste your
5:53
time with nagging requests ask for
5:56
refunds and they don't make much money
5:58
themselves 5,000 clients are rich as
6:01
long as you deliver they won't bother
6:02
you much you'll always get paid and they
6:04
won't churn after 1 month when Brett
6:07
starts his business yes he attracts $500
6:10
clients but once he pays his dues he
6:12
quickly moves to $5,000 clients and
6:15
you're probably wondering who are these
6:17
clients that are paying him $5,000 a
6:19
month the answer businesses that
6:21
wouldn't blink twice if they saw a
6:23
$5,000 per month invoice see the
6:25
client's design Joy attracts see Brett's
6:28
Service as a Ste here's why when looking
6:30
for graphic design Talent these
6:32
companies have a few options option
6:34
number one is hire a $200,000 per year
6:37
graphic designer on payroll it'll take
6:39
months to hire them and they might turn
6:41
out to be lazy option number two is
6:43
spend a bunch of money on a fancy agency
6:45
that will charge a per project fee that
6:48
might be in the range of $30 to
6:50
$40,000 and they'll take weeks if not
6:53
months to implement option number three
6:55
sort through hundreds or thousands of
6:57
cheap web designers on platform like
6:59
upwork or Fiverr and find a needle in a
7:02
hay stack or they could hire Brett a
7:05
proven graphic designer who will turn
7:07
around work in 48 hours all with the
7:09
simple click of a button at 5,000 bucks
7:12
this is a no-brainer plus they can
7:14
cancel the service whenever they want
7:16
just like a Netflix subscription hiring
7:18
a great designer is an annoying problem
7:20
for companies and Brett provides a
7:22
simple solution that companies are
7:24
clearly willing to pay for but it's not
7:26
just about the client spread ATT tracks
7:29
and that brings us to our next step step
7:31
number four high demand low
7:36
touch productize services are amazing
7:39
right you get paid for your output
7:41
rather than your time because of this
7:43
everyone in their grandma is starting
7:44
one but the truth is produ services will
7:47
not work for every kind of service and
7:50
this is the reason why Brett makes
7:51
millions when most other people make
7:53
nothing and it has to do with one word
7:56
profit as you know the profit equation
7:59
is is revenue minus expenses equals
8:01
profit but let's double click on what
8:03
these look like for design Joy on the
8:05
revenue side Brett's doing great and
8:08
that's because Brett provides a service
8:10
that is high impact a website is often
8:13
the first impression that a customer
8:15
will get of a startup and a really
8:16
beautiful website might be the
8:18
difference between success and failure
8:21
for example a high or a low conversion
8:23
rate companies must make sure they get
8:26
this right and that's why they're
8:27
willing to pay Brett a ton of money for
8:29
his service on the expenses side Brett
8:32
is also crushing it Brett has almost
8:34
zero actual dollar expenses because he's
8:37
a solopreneur his only real expense is
8:39
his time but Brett only works 6 hours a
8:42
day which isn't bad considering he has
8:44
over 16 clients at any given time and
8:47
that's because website design and
8:48
branding is relatively low touch Brett
8:51
can turn around a world-class landing
8:52
page in a couple hours that's mostly
8:55
thanks to his years of experience but
8:57
also because website design is one of
8:59
those those things that you build once
9:00
and you don't really have to touch it
9:02
for a while that is the reason design
9:04
Joy is so profitable Brad picked a
9:06
service that is both high demand and low
9:09
touch honestly I don't think this will
9:12
work as well for other services for
9:14
example a productized bookkeeping or
9:16
video editing service would definitely
9:18
not be as profitable because these
9:20
services are less in demand and also
9:23
more costly and timec consuming to
9:25
fulfill and that brings us to the final
9:27
piece of the Playbook step number five
9:30
build once sell
9:32
forever the only problem with a product
9:34
High service is that no matter what
9:36
you're still essentially trading your
9:38
hours for dollars and if you want to
9:40
truly get rich you need to find a way to
9:42
scale those dollars without scaling your
9:44
time and this is the final key move of
9:47
Brett's playbook in 2019 he spends 6
9:50
hours putting together a product called
9:52
scribbles it's a downloadable collection
9:54
of templates that other designers can
9:55
use to spice up their projects He prices
9:58
it at $4 .99 and it gets downloaded over
10:02
25,000 times but why is this a genius
10:05
move well Brett's been spending years
10:07
building up his bank of knowledge and
10:09
experience both on how to design amazing
10:12
websites and how to build a great
10:14
product High service along the way and
10:16
Brett finds a way to monetize this he
10:19
turns his knowledge into a purchasable
10:21
product that other designers can use to
10:23
improve their own business then a few
10:26
years later he takes it to the next
10:27
level he creates a course called
10:29
productize yourself that helps other
10:31
designers start their own productize
10:33
services and he charges a lot more than
10:36
five bucks for this one today these info
10:39
products make up 29% of his income and
10:42
he doesn't have to trade his hours for
10:44
these dollars because he's already put
10:46
in the work this has not only
10:48
Diversified his income but it's allowed
10:50
him to work less and probably sleep
10:52
better at night but what I love about
10:54
Brett is that he doesn't just sell
10:56
courses he continues to build his
10:58
business serve clients and put in the
11:00
Reps on design
11:04
Joy it's not luck or coincidence that
11:07
Brett is one of the highest paid
11:08
solopreneurs in the world whether he
11:10
realizes it or not this is a genius
11:12
Playbook that I think anyone doing any
11:14
kind of business should study I spent
11:16
hours researching Brett's business I
11:18
flew out to Arizona to meet him and I
11:21
just really love his business and really
11:23
wanted to share it with you guys I hope
11:24
you learn something from this that you
11:26
can apply to your own business or helps
11:28
you pick the right business idea that
11:29
you want to work on thanks for watching
11:31
The Playbook I'll see you in the next
11:37
one
